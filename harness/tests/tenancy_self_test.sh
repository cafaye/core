# tenancy_self_test.sh — the tenancy checker's proof that it is able to fail.
#
#   bash harness/tests/tenancy_self_test.sh
#
# WHAT THIS IS FOR
#
# A checker that has only ever said "yes" is a report, not a gate. This script
# takes ONE conforming fixture — a small service that declares its account
# boundary and tells the truth about all of it — copies it, breaks exactly one
# thing in each copy, and asserts the checker goes red each time. Every breakage
# names the finding it expects, so a red proves that *the check written for that
# defect* is still load-bearing, which is a different claim from "something went
# red" and the one that decays silently.
#
# The shape is harness/tests/gate_self_test.sh's, and it is the same shape for
# the same reason: a control on the unbroken fixture first (without it every red
# below proves nothing — a checker that refused everything would satisfy all of
# them), a fresh throwaway copy per case so one must never mask the next, and a
# non-zero exit if any breakage stayed green. Nothing in the committed tree is a
# deliberately broken service: the breakages are edits applied here, so a
# reviewer reads what is being broken rather than having to reconstruct it.
#
# THE SEVEN THE BRIEF NAMES, AND THE FINDING EACH ONE MUST NAME
#
#   a missing WHERE on a read          tenancy.scope-lost   on asset-fetch
#   a missing bind parameter            tenancy.bind-missing on asset-checksum-bind
#   an unscoped list                    tenancy.scope-lost   on asset-list
#   an unscoped update                  tenancy.entry-absent on asset-settle
#   an unscoped delete                  tenancy.entry-absent on asset-delete
#   IDOR on fetch-by-id                 tenancy.entry-absent on asset-variant-fetch
#   a negative weakened to *forbidden*  tenancy.denial-missing on asset-fetch
#
# `expect_red` takes a FOURTH argument — a second needle that must appear in the
# output — because six of these seven resolve to one of two findings and "went
# red" alone would not distinguish a read that lost its predicate from a delete
# that lost its predicate. The finding id says which CHECK fired; the needle says
# which ENTRY POINT it fired about, which is the claim actually being made.
#
# AND THE ONE THAT IS NOT A BREAKAGE
#
# The last section is the honesty case, and it is a WARNING that must stay
# green. `harness/tests/fixtures/tenancy/unreadable-language/` is a Go service
# whose account scoping is real and whose syntax this checker cannot read. The
# required verdict is: two warnings naming the file and line, exit 0, and NOT a
# single "no account-scoped entry points found". Counting account-scoped routes
# by pattern gave 96 for guard and 0 for darkroom, and the 0 was the checker's
# syntax rather than darkroom's — a grep that reports "this service has none"
# is worse than no grep, because it reads like an answer. `expect_green` with an
# extra assertion on the warning text is what keeps that from regressing into
# silence.
#
# WHAT IT IS NOT
#
# Not exhaustive mutation testing, and it does not claim to catch every defect.
# It proves thirty-nine specific breakages across five fixtures, four warning
# cases, six green cases, and the tri-state promise those warnings make. It does
# NOT prove the
# service's tests pass — this checker reads the negative assertion's source and
# never runs it, which harness/tenancy_findings.json says in its `notEnforced`
# list rather than leaving it to be discovered.
#
# THIRTY-NINE breakages, and every one of the twenty-six failure-severity
# findings this checker can report has a breakage naming it — which is asserted
# from core's suite by `test_every_tenancy_finding_is_proved_able_to_go_red`, so
# a finding added without a breakage is red rather than shipped untested. The
# four that fire before a boundary is even declared are the ones most likely to
# be needed first: every repository in this fleet produces `declaration-missing`
# today. The seven that are not about a finding at all — the substrate's claim
# that it is described and not enforced, its spelling, its identity, the
# credential call's control with its own counted baseline, and the same five
# policies written by hand — are below, under the substrate and the credential
# call, and they are the reason the count is not equal to the number of findings.
#
# The `# (NN)` labels below are a reading aid and NOT an index: they were written
# as cases were added near each other, so there are two `(13)`s, the database
# half's cases are interleaved with the rest, and the warning cases at the bottom
# carry numbers that no longer sit after the breakages. The number to trust is
# the one the script PRINTS in the counts block at the end, because that one is
# produced by the counter rather than by a human counting. This paragraph used to
# assert a breakdown of that number; it stopped, because the breakdown had
# drifted from the list it described and nobody could tell which was wrong.
#
# The database half — every `tenancy.rls-*` finding, the positive control, and
# (24b) — is ALSO driven in-process by
# `test_every_behavioural_check_the_checker_has_is_proved_load_bearing` in
# `tests/test_specs.py`, which is the only one of the three proofs `bin/prime`
# runs. (24b) is the case that is not a finding of its own: it proves the arm of
# `tenancy.rls-permissive` saying a policy's written roles and its declared roles
# must be the same roles, which is why thirty-nine breakages prove twenty-six
# findings.
#
# It is deliberately not inside `bin/prime`. A self-test that ran in every gate
# invocation would be a second gate that can disagree with the first, which is
# why core's CI runs it as a step of its own — and why this one is a NEW file
# rather than a section of the gate checker's self-test: the two checkers have
# different fixtures, different findings and different failure modes, and one
# script asserting both would make a red in one of them indistinguishable from a
# red in the other.

# from the identity arm, which is the claim that the exemption is one arm and not
# "the fifth policy is not checked".
#
# The spelling is `account_id = …` rather than `token_digest = …` on purpose. A

# is exempt from, so a fixture written the other way round would prove the arm
# still runs for the wrong reason.

# policies written out — four scoped by `cafaye.current_account_id()`, the fifth
# scoped by `cafaye.current_credential_digest()`, both wrapped, plus the enable
# and the force lines the template would have written. This is a TRUE declaration
# of a correct database, and it is here because keying the resolve policy's
# exemption on `generated` rather than on the PREDICATE would have reported a
# false failure against it: the same defect this packet exists to end, one level
# down and wearing a different hat. A service that wrote the policies out instead
# of adopting the call has the same boundary and the same reason the fifth is not
# account-scoped.
#
# A green case rather than a control, because the credential control below already
# pins the counted baseline of the fixture that ADOPTS the call and this one does
# not touch it. What is asserted is the count — zero `tenancy.rls-*` — because

# A SECOND PRE-EXISTING GAP, measured the same way and left alone for the same
# reason, because it is not this packet's and because its fix would change which
# finding several verified cases report. `rls.tables[].policies[].command` is
# NEVER compared against the command the migration wrote: declaring
# `assets_cafaye_select` as `command: insert` with `clause: with check` on the
# substrate fixture reports ZERO `tenancy.rls-*` findings, and so does declaring
# `api_keys_cafaye_resolve` that way on this one. So the declaration can claim a
# policy governs a command it does not govern, which for the resolve policy is the
# load-bearing property kit's own comment rests on — "`for select` and nothing
# else … there is no `insert`/`update`/`delete` counterpart" — and the checker
# does not notice.
#
# It is orthogonal to the exemption above, and it is worth saying why, because
# they look connected. `account_policy` is keyed off the policy the TEMPLATE
# wrote, not off what the declaration claims, so a declaration that lies about
# the command does not weaken the exemption — the exemption is derived from a
# fact about the migration and the lie is about a field nothing reads.
#
# Named here because a reader of this section is exactly the person who would
# otherwise assume the command is checked. The successor's second move.

# WHICH FINDING FIRES, and it is named here rather than left to a reader: the
# hand-written policy REPLACES the generated one in the relation's policy map —
# they share a name, and the last statement is the one the database ends up
# holding — so this is a WRITTEN policy from the clause checks on, and the arm
# that fires is the one saying it is scoped by nothing the checker can see. It
# does NOT fire through `ALWAYS_TRUE_CLAUSES`, and that is a pre-existing defect
# in `normalised_clause` rather than a fact about this case: it strips the
# opening paren with `_POLICY_CLAUSE` and then only strips a wrapping pair when
# the body STARTS with one, so `using (true);` normalises to `true)` and matches
# none of the four spellings. Breakage (22) has been green through the same hole
# — it fires the identity arm too, and its needle cannot tell the two apart. It
# is reported rather than fixed here, because this packet is the credential call
# and a fix that changes which finding (22) reports is a change to a case the
# previous packet verified. The successor's first move.
#
# The anchor is the CALL and not the template's `qual :=` line, and the placement
# is AFTER it rather than inside the plpgsql body. Both are load-bearing:
# `protect_credential_table` drops and recreates `<table>_cafaye_resolve` every
# time it runs, so a hand-written policy with that name BEFORE the call is not
# what the database ends up holding — the call overwrites it, and this scanner
# reads statements in the order Postgres would, so a widening placed inside the
# function body is correctly invisible. A widening after the call is what a
# migration really does, and it is the shape that holds. `drop` before `create`
# because that is what a migration has to write to get there.
# The anchor is TWO lines for the reason (32)'s is: kit's comment shows the same
# call as its example of the call, so the one-line form matches twice and `edit`
# refuses rather than editing the template's prose — which would have left the
# table protected and reported a red for nothing.
