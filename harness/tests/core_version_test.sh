# The proof that `core:` means something.
#
#   bash harness/tests/core_version_test.sh
#
# WHAT THIS IS FOR
#   Until core-17, `core: ^0.2.0` in a service manifest was a comment. The
#   harness checked that the field was *present* (`core.absent`) and that it was
#   a plausible string, and never compared it to anything — because there was
#   nothing to compare it to. Core published no version at all: `git tag -l` in
#   `cafaye/core` is empty, and the version existed only as a `## [0.2.0]`
#   heading in a changelog. So "one deploy, many services, all compiling
#   against one core" had no way to notice when the core moved under a service
#   that had said which core it wanted.
#
#   Concretely, at the time this script was written: `identity`, `courier` and
#   `guard` each declared `core: ^0.1.0` while compiling against 0.2.0 content,
#   and nothing in the fleet reported it.
#
# WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE SCRIPT AND NOT A SECTION OF `self_test.sh`
#   Two reasons, and the second is the real one. First, `self_test.sh` is
#   `gate_check.py`'s proof and mine is `cafaye_contract.py`'s; mixing them
#   means one failing file has two owners. Second — and this is the one that
#   would have rotted — every breakage in `self_test.sh` is chosen to be
#   *permanently* broken. This packet's central assertion is not: `^0.1.0`
#   stops being unsatisfiable the moment core publishes 0.3.0, so a fixture
#   pinned to it goes quietly green and nobody re-reads it. A separate script
#   derives its conflict from the version core actually publishes, which means
#   it stays red forever without anyone maintaining it.
#
# NOT PART OF `bin/prime`
#   Same reason `self_test.sh` is not: a self-test inside every gate
#   invocation is a second gate that can disagree with the first.
