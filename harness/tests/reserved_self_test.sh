# reserved_self_test.sh — can harness/reserved_check.py say NO?
#
# Its own script rather than a section of gate_self_test.sh or
# tenancy_self_test.sh, for the reason those two headers give: the three
# checkers have different fixtures, different findings and different failure
# modes, and one script asserting all three would make a red in one
# indistinguishable from a red in another.
#
# WHAT A BREAKAGE HERE ASSERTS. That the checker exits NON-ZERO **and** that the
# report names the finding it expected. The second half is the half that is easy
# to leave out and it is the half that carries the weight: a checker that is
# wired into a gate and wired wrong fails on the wrong condition, and every
# breakage here would still be red while the gate learned nothing about which
# rule it is enforcing.
#
# THE CONTROL RUNS FIRST, AND IT IS A CONTROL OVER CORE ITSELF. Not over the
# `conforming` fixture alone: `harness/reserved_check.py .` over core's own tree
# is the answer to the question a service actually asks, which is "does my
# repository pass?", and a checker that has only ever met fixtures built to trip
# it has never answered it. It was that run — not a fixture — that found the
# two defects this script's fixture set could not have: a path-form surface that
# RESOLVED and was then reported unreadable, and the checker's own
# deliberately-broken fixtures being read as fleet members. Four of the eight
# findings it produced were the checker's fixtures, and a checker that complains
# about its own test data is a checker nobody runs.
#
# So the ordering here is load-bearing in the same way it is in self_test.sh: a
# control that ran after a breakage would not have controlled it, because a tree
# that is already red makes every "the checker went red" below it vacuous.
#
# THE COPIES ARE THROWAWAY AND THE WORKTREE IS NOT TOUCHED. Every breakage runs
# in a `mktemp -d` copy, for the same reason the harness self-test does it: the
# gate has a `git diff --exit-code` step over the whole tracked tree, and a
# self-test that mutated it would either trip that step or be caught by it after
# the fact.
