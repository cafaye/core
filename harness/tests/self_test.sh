#
# The harness's proof that it is able to fail.
#
#   bash harness/tests/self_test.sh
#
# WHAT THIS IS FOR
#   A conformance tool that has only ever said "yes" is a report, not a gate.
#   This script copies the fixtures to a throwaway directory, breaks one thing
#   at a time, and asserts the harness goes RED each time. Every breakage names
#   the rule id it expects, so a red proves that *the check written for that
#   defect* is still load-bearing — which is a different claim from "something
#   went red", and the one that decays silently.
#
#   kit's `tests/self_test.sh` is the precedent and the shape is copied: a
#   control on the unbroken tree first (without it the breakages prove nothing),
#   a fresh throwaway copy per breakage (one must never mask the next), and a
#   non-zero exit if any breakage stayed green.
#
#   The breakages are chosen the way kit chose its mutants: not a typo a
#   reviewer would see, but the mistake that looks like diligence. A harness
#   that rejects `name: Billing` is not the claim; a harness that rejects a
#   document with *two* /vN prefixes, or one that reports three of five
#   convention rules and exits 0, is.
#
# WHAT IT IS NOT
#   Not exhaustive mutation testing. It does not prove the harness catches every
#   defect, and nothing here should be read as claiming that it does. It proves
#   thirty-seven specific things — nine of them the readable half of the HTTP
#   contract — plus three warning cases that must stay green, and it proves both
#   controls before any of it.
#
# THE TWO CONTROLS, AND WHY THERE ARE TWO
#   `fixtures/conforming` is "the smallest document that satisfies every rule the
#   harness could decide": one GET, one 200, no error path, no pagination, no
#   mutating POST. That is the right control for the rules that existed when it
#   was written and the wrong fixture for the eight that decide the error
#   envelope, the pagination envelope and idempotency — `openapi.errors-are-
#   problems` cannot fail in a document with no non-2xx response, so a breakage
#   aimed at it there would be proving that a rule cannot fire.
#   `fixtures/conforming-openapi` carries all three families conforming, so
#   breaking one is a statement about the rule rather than about the fixture.

# 19. `paths: {}`. The rule that exists because two empty sets agree: a

# 21. The SLO rules. Eight breakages, one per rule, and each one names the rule it
#     must be caught by rather than merely proving that something went red — with
#     twenty-eight checks in this script, "the gate went red" is a claim about
#     almost nothing.
#
#     Breakages 23 and 24 are the two denylists, and both are written as they
#     arrived rather than as the queries they eventually became: a service adds
#     `tenant_id` or a memory limit to its **declared labels** first and to its
#     queries second. The first version of `_denylisted` scanned only the
#     queries, so both of these came back as `slo.sli-canonical` — a true
#     statement about a consequence, reported in place of the mistake. A rule
#     that names the wrong thing is a rule nobody acts on, and this is the
#     second time in this repository that only running the thing at its fixtures
#     found it.
#
#     Breakages 22-25 are the ones the rulings name: the query with no
#     `{{.window}}` (the highest-value check in the file, and one Sloth does not

#     pages. The last of those is enforced in a SCHEMA, and it is here anyway:
#     a rule that lives in `schemas/` is still a rule the harness can be proved
#     able to report, and the breakage is how we know the file it lives in is the
#     file the harness reads.

# 29-37. The readable half of the HTTP contract: docs/openapi-conventions.md's
#     error envelope, pagination envelope and idempotency, decided from a
#     document. Nine breakages for eight rules, because `openapi.page-envelope`
#     has two independently reachable halves and a reader is owed both.
#
#     All nine aim at `conforming-openapi`, which is the control above. The
#     mutations are the mistakes the conventions were written about rather than
#     typos: the error schema defined and attached to nothing, a code reworded
#     without the `type` it is the last segment of, a reserved code at the wrong
#     status, `trace_id` demoted from `required` to merely declared, `limit`
#     renamed `offset`, a cursor renamed `before`, the envelope renamed, the
#     idempotency header removed, and the 409 removed while the header stays.
#
#     `identity`'s audit log is what breakage 31 imitates: `limit` and `before`
#     declared, `{"entries": …, "next": …}` returned. It is a correct pagination
#     design that is not core's, and this is the rule that says so by name.
