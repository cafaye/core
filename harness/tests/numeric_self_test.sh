# numeric_self_test.sh — the numeric checker's proof that it is able to fail.
#
#   bash harness/tests/numeric_self_test.sh
#
# WHAT THIS IS FOR
#
# A checker that has only ever said "yes" is a report, not a gate. This script
# takes ONE conforming fixture — a small contract surface where every numeric
# position is one this checker is content with — copies it, breaks exactly one
# thing in each copy, and asserts the checker goes red each time. Every
# breakage names the finding it expects, so a red proves that *the check written
# for that defect* is still load-bearing, which is a different claim from
# "something went red" and the one that decays silently.
#
# The shape is harness/tests/tenancy_self_test.sh's, and it is the same shape for
# the same reason: a control on the unbroken fixture FIRST (without it every red
# below proves nothing — a checker that refused everything would satisfy all of
# them), a fresh throwaway copy per case so one must never mask the next, and a
# non-zero exit if any breakage stayed green. Nothing in the committed tree is a
# deliberately broken contract: the breakages are edits applied here, to copies,
# so a reviewer reads what is being broken rather than reconstructing it.
#
# THE FOUR RULES, AND WHAT EACH ONE MUST BE PROVED ABLE TO DO
#
#   numeric.float64-unsafe  FAILURE. An integer whose declared maximum reaches
#                           the float64 exact range, an integer with no maximum
#                           at all on a field whose name says it carries an
#                           identity, or an integer ENUM with a member past it.
#                           It must be a string.
#   numeric.float           WARNING. `type: number`. It is a ratio, and a ratio
#                           that cannot be a whole number is not a rounding bug.
#   numeric.enum            WARNING. Codegen turns it into a closed union.
#   numeric.unsigned        NOT ENFORCED, and this script proves the SHAPE of
#                           that decision rather than its absence: a bare
#                           `minimum: 0` must stay GREEN, and the report must
#                           say out loud that unsignedness is unenforced. A rule
#                           examined and excluded on purpose is a decision; the
#                           same rule excluded silently is the defect.
#
# WHY THE ENUM IS A THIRD WAY IN, AND NOT A FOURTH RULE
#
# An enum is a STRONGER statement than a maximum, not a weaker one. A maximum
# bounds a range the writer may stay inside; an enum enumerates the COMPLETE SET
# of legal values, so a member at or past 2**53 is a value the contract
# REQUIRES, not one it merely tolerates. It shares the id rather than becoming
# `numeric.enum-unsafe` because the distinction this checker draws everywhere is
# *can this value cross the wire wrong* — and it can, by one, in the one
# language that rounds everything. `numeric.enum` stays a WARNING and stays a
# SEPARATE finding, so one node can now produce both: it is an unrepresentable
# value AND a closed union, and those are two true statements about it.
#
# THREE THINGS THAT BRANCH DECIDES, each proved below rather than argued here.
#
#   * MAGNITUDE, not sign. The rule it joins read `maximum`, which is one number
#     and the wrong bound for a set. `enum: [-9007199254740993, 0]` is caught
#     below and was SILENT before: the reader's question is "how big is any of
#     them", and a signed comparison cannot answer it.
#   * EXACTLY 2**53 is NOT caught, in either direction. 2**53 is exactly
#     representable and round-trips through JSON.stringify/JSON.parse, so an
#     enum whose largest member sits ON it is a document that is correct. The
#     declared-maximum branch fires at `>=` and this one at `>` — measured, not
#     accidental, and the reasoning is in D44.
#   * ONE node, ONE finding. A position with both a crossing maximum and a
#     crossing enum gets the maximum's message and not a second copy of the same
#     id. Case (15) asserts the COUNT, because a finding printed twice reads as
#     two problems where there is one.
#
# WHY numeric.unsigned IS NOT A BREAKAGE HERE
#
# Because there is no unsigned integer type in JSON at all. Go has no unsigned
# JSON, TypeScript has no unsigned number, and Python's bool IS an int, so the
# fact is not in any document this checker reads — it is in a service's own
# types. A rule that fired on the fleet's 45 `minimum: 0` positions would fire
# on every field of a passing contract, and a gate like that is switched off
# within one release, which leaves the fleet with NO check rather than an
# incomplete one. So the green case below is the proof: it stays green, it names
# why, and the notEnforced ledger carries the measured count.
#
# AND THE CASE THAT IS NOT ABOUT A FINDING AT ALL
#
# `unreadable/` is a malformed document. The required verdict is: a warning that
# NAMES the file, and an exit code of zero. A checker that answered "no numeric
# problems" over a file it could not parse would be converting an unknown into a
# green badge — the fourth repository to be told about that defect is identity's
# TEST_DATABASE_URL, and the rule in AGENTS.md is that a run which could not
# happen is reported, never folded into a pass.
#
# WHAT IT IS NOT
#
# It does NOT run against a real service checkout, and it does NOT prove the
# fleet's own surfaces are clean — that is a separate claim, measured in
# REPORT-core-numeric-01.md §5 from static facts only, because `harness/` may
# not take a dependency or open a connection. Nor does it prove that any of the
# six languages reads these fields correctly: this checker reads documents, and a
# service's own typed client is what proves that a Go int64 became a TypeScript
# number. What it proves is narrower and is the thing this packet exists for:
# that the CONTRACT did not invite it.
#
# THE `# (NN)` labels below are a reading aid and NOT an index. The number to
# trust is the one this script PRINTS in the counts block, because that one is
# produced by the counter rather than by a human counting.
#
# It is deliberately NOT inside `bin/prime`. A self-test that ran in every gate
# invocation would be a second gate that can disagree with the first, which is
# why core's CI runs harness/tests/self_test.sh and tenancy_self_test.sh as steps
# of their own — and why `bin/prime` still runs gate_self_test.sh, which is a
# different checker (see bin/prime's own header for why that asymmetry is
# deliberate and dated).

# EVERY mutation below edits the ONE field the control uses for a closed set of
# WORDS, and every one of them is confined to the `enum` and the `type`: no
# `maximum` is added anywhere in this group except in (15), which is about the
# count, and no identity-shaped name is involved at all. That confinement is the
# whole claim of this section. A rule that had quietly lost its enum branch would
# keep cases (1)-(5) perfectly green and turn every red below into a green, so
# the mutation that is aimed at the enum cannot be satisfied by a neighbouring
# trigger — which is exactly the mistake `expect_red`'s `needle` argument exists
# to catch elsewhere. Every anchor is the CONTROL's own text, never something the
# case above it wrote; see `edit` for why that is now a failure rather than a
# silent no-op.

# The green cases here are the other half and they are not padding. An off-by-one
