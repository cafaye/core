-- 0002_rls.sql — the DATABASE half of the boundary, for `tenant-fixture`.
--
-- 0001_assets.sql scopes every statement in the repository layer. This file is
-- the second, independent enforcement: row-level security, so a query the
-- repository forgot to scope still cannot reach another account's rows. The two
-- are independent on purpose — every line here could be deleted and the
-- repository predicates would still hold, and every repository predicate could be
-- dropped and these policies would still hold.
--
-- Every construct below is a rule, and the reason is in its comment:
--
--   * `enable row level security` — without it the policies below are never
--     evaluated at all, and a policy that is never evaluated raises nothing.
--   * `force row level security` — **the line this whole packet exists for.**
--     Postgres does not apply row-level security to a table's OWNER unless the
--     table is forced, and this service owns the tables it created in its own
--     schema. Omit it and every policy on this table is decoration: the queries
--     still succeed, the policies still exist, and `tenant_app` reads every row
--     in the database. `force` is its own reloptions bit, so it can be present
--     without the enable bit above it — which is why the schema says `forced`
--     and the checker looks for it rather than assuming it.
--   * `to tenant_app` — a policy with no `to` clause applies to PUBLIC.
--   * `(select app.current_account())` — wrapped, so Postgres evaluates it once
--     per statement. The bare call is re-evaluated for every row.
--   * `set search_path = ''` on the SECURITY DEFINER function — otherwise a
--     caller can point an unqualified name at an object they created and have
--     the function resolve to it with the owner's rights.
--   * `security_invoker = on` on the view — a view without it reads with its
--     OWNER's privileges, so the reader's policies never run.

-- The identity every policy reads. SECURITY DEFINER so the runtime role cannot
-- read arbitrary settings out of the session, and `set search_path = ''` because
-- without a pinned search path a caller can point an unqualified name at their
-- own object and run it with this function's owner's rights. The GUC is
-- `app.current_account` rather than `app.account_id` so that this file's own
-- text cannot be mistaken for a statement scoping a row.
