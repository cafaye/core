WHY A SEPARATE FILE, AND WHY IT MAKES NO FINDINGS
-------------------------------------------------
`harness/breaking_tiers.json` is the only place in this repository that says
which surface a change breaks, and this is the only code that reads it. Those
cannot be two files: a table and a reader that disagree is a table that reports
tiers nobody classified.

This module makes NO findings and declares no rules in `harness/rules.json`, and
that is deliberate rather than an omission. The ids in that inventory are asserted
equal to `cafaye_contract.RULE_IDS`, so a finding here would either have to be
declared in an inventory that inventories a different checker, or would have to be
added to `cafaye_contract.py`, which is the wrong home for a fact about a table
that is not a manifest. What this file does instead is refuse to be wrong: a tier
name that is not one of three, a rule with no tiers, a rule whose tiers do not
correspond to any selection, a rule row that duplicates another's id — each of
those raises, so `tests/test_specs.py` cannot assert a table that has quietly
become three names for one thing.

The tiers, in full, so there is nothing left to the reader's memory:

  * `SOURCE` — generated source code, types and clients. `caf gen` output that
    no longer compiles. buf's `FILE` and `PACKAGE`, which are the same idea at
    two scopes.
  * `JSON` — the serialized document: a key changes, a value stops validating, a
    status stops being documented. buf's `WIRE_JSON` without its WIRE half.
  * `WIRE` — what the bytes actually carry: a type moves between encodings, or a
    slot is removed and can never come back.

`packaging`: stdlib only, and it imports nothing from `cafaye_contract` or from
`tenancy_check`, because a module that reached into a sibling for one type would
make the sibling's edit this file's break. The table's shape is checked here
rather than against `schemas/`, and `test_the_published_table_is_a_valid_schema`
is what says why that is not the shortcut it looks like.
