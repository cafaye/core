"""gate_check — does a repository's gate declaration still describe its gate?

    gate-check .                       # static: the declaration against the tree
    gate-check --prove .               # also RUNS the declared gate and checks its proofs
    gate-check --json .                # the same findings, as JSON

WHAT THIS IS

A gate that is discovered by getting it wrong is not a gate. Measured across the
fleet this was written for, there were five different spellings of "run the
gate" across fifteen repositories: `mise run prime` in nine of them,
`mise x -- ./bin/prime` in two, a task named `test` rather than `prime` in one,
`bash tests/validate.sh` in one, and — in the new repository — a task named
`gate` whose `run` string names a file that does not exist. Every one of those
was found by a human getting it wrong, which means every one of them is found
the same way again the next time.

So the gate is *declared*, in `gate.yml`, against `schemas/gate.schema.json`,
and this file checks the declaration against the repository it is in. The
checks are deliberately small and mechanical:

  * the command exists, and the file behind it exists and is executable;
  * the mise task the fleet's spelling resolves to is in `mise.toml`, and its
    `run` string still resolves to that same file;
  * the CI workflow the declaration names actually invokes the gate;
  * every external requirement names an argv you can paste, not a sentence;
  * and — the one no other check on this list can do — **running** the gate
    makes it emit every proof it promised.

THE PROOF IS THE POINT

Every other check here is string matching, and a checker that only string
matches is satisfied by a gate that exits 0 without having run anything. That
is not a hypothetical shape: it is what `exit 0` at the end of a mis-edited
script looks like, what a `--dry-run` that got left in looks like, and what a
`tests/validate.sh` that is a three-line exec of a file nobody noticed was
deleted looks like.

So a declaration carries `gate.proof`: one or more patterns that the gate's own
output must contain, with an optional `minimum` floor read from a single
capture group. A run that exits 0 without emitting a declared proof is
`gate.proof-missing`, and it is a **failure**. That is the whole difference
between this and a file that says `mise run prime`.

TWO PHASES, AND WHY

`--prove` runs the gate. The default does not, and `bin/prime` therefore calls
this checker *without* `--prove`: a gate that proves itself by running itself
proves nothing and terminates. So the static phase is the one a gate may run
about itself, the proving phase is the one CI and the red-proof self-test run,
and the split is stated in docs/gate.md rather than left to be discovered.

WHAT THIS NEVER PRINTS, AND WHY

No off-the-shelf tool detects a secret *leaked at runtime* into a log or an
error string — 0 of 268 Semgrep rules intersect CWE-532, gosec has no
`ast.CallExpr` case, Bandit is `ast.Constant`-only. So this file never prints
a command's environment, never prints a value read from one, and never prints
the gate's own output. A finding carries the command **as written** and a
remediation a reader can paste; the gate's stdout goes to a log file whose path
is reported, and reading it is the reader's decision. `tests/test_specs.py`
asserts this against a fixture whose gate prints the value of a variable from
its environment, so the property is a test and not a promise.

TRI-STATE, AND WHAT A WARNING IS NOT

Findings are `ok`, `warn` or `fail`, which is yamine's shape as MD13 recorded
it. **`warn` never moves the exit code.** A gate built on booleons forces a
choice between "fail on warnings" (noisy, gets disabled) and "ignore them" (the
report is a lie); three states are the only way out. The three warnings here are
all the same kind of thing — *this machine cannot answer that* — and a checker
that turned them into failures would be one that fails on a laptop and passes
on CI.

EXIT CODES

    0   no finding at severity `fail`. Warnings may still be printed.
    1   at least one `fail`.
    2   the check could not happen. Never 0, and never 1: a run that could not
        find the declaration has not found the gate, and converting an unknown
        into a green badge is the defect this repository exists to prevent.

# see is how the gate is written in guard/ci.yml:65, parlor/ci.yml:81, and every
# repository this standard has been adopted into since. `gate.ci-disagrees` fired
# on correct workflows, which is the same defect as staying quiet on broken ones:
# both teach the reader to ignore the finding, and this one taught it on the
# first repository that adopted the standard. The caller's `if not
# matched.group("block")` branch for `run: <command>` on one line was DEAD CODE
# the whole time — no input could ever reach it. That is the signature of a
# pattern that was written for one fixture and never met another.
#

#
#   (?:-\s+)?     the sequence-item spelling, `- run: x`. Zero occurrences in
#                 this fleet's twelve workflow trees, and included anyway: it is
#                 the same key in the same position, and a pattern that cannot
#                 see it fails silently in exactly the way the anchor failed. A
#                 shape absent from today's tree is not a shape that should be
#                 invisible. Handling it here rather than in the caller keeps one
#                 key in one place — splitting it would make the reader check
#                 both.
#   [|>][+-]?\d*  a block scalar. `\d*` is the explicit indentation indicator
#                 (`run: |2`), which is rare and harmless to accept.
#   inline        `\S.*?` — the command, when it is on the key's own line. It is
#                 NOT `\S+`, because a command with arguments and a quoted
#                 variable is the common case, not the exotic one:
#                 `run: cargo llvm-cov --fail-under-lines "$COVERAGE_FAIL_UNDER"`.

    question being asked is only "does any step's command mention this argv",
    and a substring over the run bodies answers it without a parser.

    Two rules, and the second is the one that is easy to get wrong:

    The block-scalar rule is indentation, not a blank line: a `run: |` body

    body, and a body that stops early is a body whose second half nobody reads.

    The comment rule: a `run:` whose value is nothing but a comment carries no

    continuation or nothing — never a command. `run: # TODO: wire up bin/gate`

    A trailing comment on a line that DOES carry a command is not stripped.
    `run: bin/gate 2>&1 | tee "$LOG"  # the gate` keeps its `# the gate`, because

    The policy, in full, with its reasoning in docs/gate.md. Three answers, and

    is how the one-line `run:` bug happened:

    A PASS, in three shapes. Every element of `invokes` appearing in some `run:`
    body — ONCE OR ANY NUMBER OF TIMES, because `invokes` claims the gate is
    REACHABLE from CI, not how often it is reached; core's own workflow runs
    `bin/prime` AND `bin/prime --pytest`, and asserting on the count would fire
    on the repository that wrote the rule. Or the body calling the mise task the
    declaration names, which this checker has separately proven resolves to the
    declared entrypoint. Or a job that only calls a reusable workflow, sitting
    beside a step that runs the gate — which is guard and parlor both.

    A WARNING when the body defers to a task runner and the gate is not visible.
    This checker reads no Makefile and no shell script, so a `make gate` step and
    a `make gate` step whose target was emptied look identical to it. Failing
    there is the false red this checker spent a release committing; staying
    silent is the false green. It says what it cannot see and exits 0.

    A FAILURE when the run bodies contain nothing that gates at all. CI plainly
    does not run the gate, and that is the whole job of this check.

    The warning tier's leak is real and is named rather than hidden: a workflow
    whose only task invocation is unrelated also warns instead of failing, so
    deleting the gate step from a repository that also runs `mise run lint` costs
    a warning rather than a red. The message says so, and says how to settle it.
