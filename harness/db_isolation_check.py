WHAT THIS IS FOR

`darkroom` shipped with 54 database tests sharing one `TEST_DATABASE_URL` and
all truncating the same tables in it. `cargo test` parallelizes by default, so
two tests deleted each other's fixtures mid-assert. Measured on the pre-change
tree, six runs of six exited 101 with 12, 12 and 15 distinct failures and a
DIFFERENT SET EACH RUN, which is what makes it a race and not a bug. The
symptom was never a lock timeout:

    the_same_bytes_in_two_accounts_are_two_assets
    assertion `left == right` failed
      left: 4     <- created two assets, read four: two other tests' rows
     right: 2

That is the worst kind of test failure to debug, because it reads as a product
defect. And `TEST_DATABASE_URL` names the same database the SERVICE uses, so a
truncate that quietly empties those tables is a way to delete production rows
from a test run.

`darkroom` is fixed — each test migrates into a schema of its own and truncates
only that schema. This checker is what stops the next service from having to be
audited by hand, and it lives in `core` because `core` is where every service's
gate runs.

THE THREE THINGS, AND WHY A SERVICE MISSING ONE IS SAFE

The hazard needs all three at once, and this checker reports which one is
missing rather than a yes/no verdict, because "safe" is a claim about a
mechanism and the mechanism is per-language:

  1. tests that share one database;
  2. a cleanup that deletes rows another test can SEE — a table-wide DELETE,
     TRUNCATE, `delete_all`, or a transactional fixture that was turned off;
  3. a runner that executes those tests CONCURRENTLY.

(3) is the one that differs by language and the one that gets guessed wrong in
both directions. Measured per language, and each rule below is a reading of a
real repository that was then RUN:

  * Rust      parallel by default. `#[test]` functions in one binary are
              threads. This is why darkroom was the one that broke.
  * Go        NOT parallel unless a test calls `t.Parallel()`, but `go test ./...`
              runs PACKAGES in parallel up to `-p`. Two packages sharing a DSN
              and both opting in is the shape.
  * ExUnit    a module's cases run sequentially unless marked `async: true`, and
              async modules run concurrently with EACH OTHER. So the question is
              not "are cases concurrent" but "are two `async: true` modules
              sharing a database" — and whether the SQL sandbox is in play.
  * minitest  Rails parallelizes into FORKED PROCESSES, each given its OWN
              database (`<name>_0`, `<name>_1`, …). Measured, not assumed: see
              the `processes` mechanism below.
  * pytest    sequential unless `pytest-xdist` or `pytest-parallel` is installed
              AND asked for. The dependency, not the intent.
  * bun       `bun test` runs files in one process, sequentially.

A service with (1) and (2) but not (3) is LATENTLY DANGEROUS: one `async: true`,
one `t.Parallel()`, or one `-p 8` away from darkroom's bug. That is reported as
a finding of its own severity, not folded into "safe".

WHAT THIS CHECKER DOES NOT CLAIM

It reads source, so it can only see what is written down. A test that deletes
another test's rows through a helper in another file, or a concurrency opt-in
set by an environment variable rather than a literal, is not visible here. That
is why the inventory calls the mechanism it read rather than asserting the
suite is safe, and why `docs/db-isolation.md` says to run the suite for the
service that matters.

THE EXIT CODES, WHICH ARE THE WHOLE CONTRACT

  0   no failure. Latent findings are printed and DO NOT move the exit code.
  1   at least one failure — the hazard is present, or is present minus the
      thing that would set it off.
  2   the check could not happen. Never 0, and never collapsed into 1.
