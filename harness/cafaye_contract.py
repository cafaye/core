"""The cafaye contract-test harness.

PLAN.md §4 Phase 0 named a contract-test harness among core v0's deliverables.
Three of the other four shipped; this is the fifth, and until now every service
that wanted one wrote its own — muse's pinned-SHA byte comparison, darkroom's
copy of core's schema, courier's document-against-router test, pantry's drift
test. Four mechanisms, no shared harness, which is the platform's headline
artifact declining to be the thing every service builds on.

    harness/bin/cafaye-contract --core ../core .

answers, offline, with nothing installed: does this repository's declared
contract surface agree with core's contracts?

WHY IT IS A SINGLE PYTHON FILE WITH NO DEPENDENCIES
---------------------------------------------------
The fleet is six languages and a service's CI runner is the environment that
matters. A Python *package* would need a venv in a Go repository; a compiled
binary would make core a release repository with per-platform artifacts, which
is the one thing it is not. A single file that imports only the standard library
runs on every runner core and every service already builds on, and it reads
`--core <dir>` — so a service's CI is three lines and no language binding.

That has one real cost, and this file is where it lives: **core's schemas are
JSON Schema, and the standard library has no JSON Schema.** So this file
contains an evaluator for the keywords core's schemas actually use, and
`tests/test_specs.py` proves it is the same answer `jsonschema` gives, over
every example in `examples/`, in both directions and by violated keyword. Read
that test before trusting the evaluator. Two consequences are deliberate:

  - `IMPLEMENTED_KEYWORDS` is exactly the keyword inventory of `schemas/`, and a
    core test fails if the two drift. A keyword this file does not implement is
    a rule the harness does not enforce, and an unenforced rule looks exactly
    like an upheld one.
  - `CHECKED_FORMATS` includes `uri`, which `jsonschema` does **not** check
    without `rfc3987-validator` installed — so on a `format: uri` failure these
    two disagree, and the harness is the stricter one. That is stated in
    docs/contract-harness.md and is decision D22.

THE SAME IS TRUE OF THE YAML READER
-----------------------------------
`cafaye.yml` and every service's OpenAPI document are YAML, PyYAML is not in the
standard library, and adding a dependency is a decision this repository has not
made. So `read_yaml` reads a **declared subset** (`YAML_REFUSALS` is everything
it refuses) and refuses everything else with a file and a line. It never guesses:
a multi-line plain scalar is legal YAML, and folding it one way means validating
a document nobody wrote. A core test proves the reader agrees with PyYAML on
every YAML document core owns.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
-------------------
It does not validate live responses against the event payload schemas. That is
still owed; see docs/contract-harness.md, which is the document that says so
out loud.

It does resolve a `core:` constraint, as of core-17 — it did not for its whole
life before that, and the reason was worth stating: there was nothing to resolve
*against*. Core published no version, so a `core:` field was a comment with a
pattern on it. Core now publishes `VERSION` at its root, and the resolver is
`harness/core_version.py`. What the check still cannot do is notice that CI
fetched the wrong core, because it reads the checkout it is handed; that half
is a convention in docs/core-version.md and not yet a rule.

Nor does it compare an OpenAPI document to the service's router. That needs the
service's language — courier reads `Router.__routes__/0` in ExUnit, muse compares
against a live FastAPI app — and courier's own test stays. The *readable* half is
built: the nine reserved error codes and their statuses, `application/problem+json`
on every non-2xx, `trace_id`, the pagination envelope, offset pagination as a
violation, and `Idempotency-Key` with its 409 on every mutating `POST`.

WARNINGS, AND WHY THEY ARE NOT RULES
------------------------------------
A finding turns a build red. A warning cannot, and `Result.exit_code` never
looks at one. They exist because the honest answer to "did the harness check
this?" is sometimes *no*: of the thirteen repositories in the cafaye workspace,
six declare `exposes.api` and seven declare none; seven check in an OpenAPI
document and one of them — guard — ships one that no manifest names. A rule
that enforced the document would therefore turn seven of them red the moment
core updated, which is not a fleet adopting a check, it is a fleet deleting one.
So the harness says what it did not look at, in a prefix a log can filter,
and stays green — and `openapi.not-declared` is the one that matters, because
it is the difference between a service with no HTTP contract and a service whose
HTTP contract nobody is checking.

EXIT CODES
----------
    0   the service conforms
    1   it does not — every broken rule is on stdout, one per line
    2   the run could not happen: core was not found, the service has no
        manifest, or a file is outside the YAML subset

2 is not a soft 1. A check that could not run, exiting 0, is the defect that has
bitten this fleet four times — guard's live-Redis tier, muse's `MUSE_CORE_SCHEMAS`
tier, identity's `TEST_DATABASE_URL` tier, darkroom's `--ignored` tests — and a
contract check that cannot find the contract is worse than no contract check,
because it converts an unknown into a green badge.

# Everything below is a spelling in that document, copied once so the rules that
# use it cannot drift from each other: nine reserved codes with their statuses
# here, the same nine in a message in the document, and a reader comparing the
# two should find nothing to compare.

#: The nine reserved codes and the status each one carries. `docs/openapi-conventions.md`,
#: "Error envelope": "Reserved codes: `unauthorized` (401), `forbidden` (403),
#: `not_found` (404), `conflict` (409), `validation_failed` (422),
#: `rate_limited` (429), `idempotency_key_reused` (409), `internal` (500),
#: `unavailable` (503)."
#:
#: **Reserved is a floor, not a ceiling, and the fleet proves it.** Measured over
#: the seven OpenAPI documents in the cafaye workspace, reading the envelope
#: `code` of every problem example and the `code` enum of every problem schema:
#: `guard` carries `invalid_json`, `account_locked` and `payload_too_large`;
#: `identity` adds `method_not_allowed` and `service_unavailable`; `billing` and
#: `courier` document `bad_request` for the 400 both explain in prose; `pantry`
#: carries `method_not_allowed`; and core's own conventions name two codes that
#: are not on the list at all — `cursor_expired` (400) and `gone` (410). **Five of
#: the seven documents use an envelope code outside the nine**, so a rule
#: requiring every code to be one of them would be wrong about five. What *is*
#: decided is the binding in the other direction: a reserved code means one
#: status, so a client that sees `unauthorized` can act on 401 without reading the
#: document. `muse` and `darkroom` use only the nine, which is the other half of
#: the argument — the floor is a floor, not a formality, because two documents
#: in this fleet already keep to it.
#:
#: `errors[].code` is deliberately **not** counted anywhere: the conventions' own
#: example holds `invalid_format` there, which is not one of the nine and is not
#: supposed to be. A field-level code names a *field's* failure class; the
#: envelope `code` names the failure itself, and only the second is reserved.

# the JSON Schema evaluator

#
# Draft 2020-12, for the keywords in `IMPLEMENTED_KEYWORDS` and no others. The
# semantics that are easy to get wrong, and what the right answer is:
#
#   * `$ref` does not replace the schema. In 2020-12 a `$ref`'s siblings apply
#     alongside whatever the pointer resolves to, so both are evaluated.
#   * `if` never reports. It is a condition; only `then` produces violations, and
#     only when the condition held. A schema that used `if` as a validator would
#     report failures of its own precondition as failures of the document.
#   * `allOf` reports its subschemas' own keywords, not `allOf`; `oneOf` and
#     `anyOf` report themselves, because "matched two of two" has no better name.
#   * `true` and `false` are not integers and are not numbers. Every library
#     agrees and it is still worth writing down.
#   * `pattern` is an unanchored ECMA-262 regular expression, so `re.search` is
#     right and `re.match` would reject a document `jsonschema` accepts.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# the YAML reader
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A declared subset, and the honest edge of it is `YAML_REFUSALS` above: every
# construct this will not read, with the reason. The reader exists because the
# standard library has no YAML and adding a dependency is a decision this
# repository has not made — so it reads what `cafaye.yml` and an OpenAPI
# document actually contain, and refuses the rest.
#
# WHAT THE SUBSET IS, and how it was chosen
# ----------------------------------------
# Not by taste. The first version of this reader refused block scalars, flow
# collections and continued plain scalars, and then it was pointed at the eleven
# real service repositories in the cafaye workspace: **eight of eleven
# refused** — six on a `description:` field in their OpenAPI document, two on a
# leading `---`, and the rest on `tags: [users]`. A harness that cannot read the
# documents it exists to check is a demonstration, so all of it is in, and the
# subset is now the one the fleet writes rather than the one that was convenient
# to parse. What the fleet writes is the whole justification: every construct
# below is here because a real `cafaye.yml` or a real `openapi/*.yaml` in the
# workspace uses it, and nothing is here because it was easy.
#
# WHY `raw` IS KEPT
# -----------------
# A block scalar's body is content, not structure: a `#` in it is a hash, a blank
# line in it is a newline, and a `key: value` line in it is a sentence. The first
# version stripped comments and blank lines once, up front, and could not have
# read a block scalar correctly even if it had tried — the information is gone by
# the time the parser sees the line. So every line keeps its original text and
# the structural parsers skip blanks explicitly. That is the whole difference
# between the two designs, and it is why `_Line` carries four fields rather than
# three.
#
# WHAT IS STILL REFUSED
# ---------------------
# Anchors, aliases, tags, merge keys, non-empty flow collections, multi-line
# plain scalars, tab indentation, and duplicate keys. None of them appears in
# the eleven real service repositories. The first version *accepted* the first
# three by accident — a refusal loop compared a value starting `&` against the
# key `"&anchor"` and matched nothing — and
# `test_the_harness_yaml_reader_refuses_only_what_it_declares` probes for exactly
# those three, which is the only reason it was caught.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# the readable half of the HTTP contract
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# docs/contract-harness.md said this was owed, in its own words:
#
#     The *readable* half — the reserved error codes, the pagination envelope,
#     `Idempotency-Key` on retryable `POST`s — is decidable from a document
#     alone and is still owed.
#
# Eight rules, in the three families the document names. What they share is a
# shape: each one reads a document and asks a question a client can also ask,
# and each one is written so that **not being able to read the answer produces a
# different output from reading a wrong one.** That distinction is the whole
# engineering content of this section. A checker that reports "no
# `application/problem+json` here" about a response hidden behind a `$ref` into
# another file is not strict, it is lying, and it sends a service owner to a
# document that is already correct.
#
# So: a local `$ref` is resolved, a non-local one is not, and every node whose
# answer came from behind an unread pointer is counted and reported as
# `openapi.unresolved-ref` rather than judged. The one thing this section will
# not do is return an empty list that means "I did not look" where a reader
# would take it for "there was nothing to find".
#
# WHAT IS NOT HERE, AND WHY
# -------------------------
#   * The document against the router. It needs the service's language, which is
#     the argument docs/contract-harness.md already made and this section does
#     not re-open. courier's ExUnit test stays.
#   * `errors[]` present only on 422. Readable, but only from an *example*, and
#     a rule that fires when a document happens to carry no examples is a rule
#     whose answer depends on how much prose an author wrote. The stronger half
#     of the same sentence — a reserved code carries its fixed status — is
#     enforced, and the example-only half is named in rules.json's notEnforced.
#   * `next_cursor` being nullable. `nullable: true` is OpenAPI 3.0 spelling and
#     `type: [string, "null"]` is 3.1's, courier's 3.1 document uses the first,
#     and deciding that here would accuse a document of a pagination mistake for
#     a versioning one. It belongs to a dialect rule, which is not this packet.
