"""reserved_check — does a tombstoned property name stay reserved?

    reserved-check <fleet-root>            # the tombstones against the contracts
    reserved-check --explain               # every finding this checker can report
    reserved-check --json <fleet-root>     # the same findings, as JSON

WHAT THIS IS

`harness/breaking_tiers.json` publishes a rule called `reserved-no-delete`,
classified SOURCE + JSON, whose `why` reads: *"tombstoning the name is what
keeps the slot from being reused, so delete-and-tombstone is the wire-safe form
and delete-and-say-nothing is not."* Until this file existed, nothing
implemented that. The string `x-cafaye-reserved-properties` appeared once in
the fleet — in that sentence. A rule that names a mechanism that does not exist
is documentation.

The mechanism is a name reuse hazard, and it is worth stating in full because
every finding below is one clause of it:

  1. Service A publishes a property called `invoice_id`.
  2. A consumer generates source against it, and the generated struct carries
     the field name.
  3. A deletes the property, and puts the NAME on `x-cafaye-reserved-properties`.
  4. Later, an unrelated field wants the same name. Nothing in step 3's absence
     stops it, so it is published.
  5. The consumer upgrades its generated source. It compiles. It reads a
     DIFFERENT field under a name it already trusted, and nothing errors
     anywhere — not in the consumer, not in A, not in the generator.

Tombstoning the name is the whole of the defence, and it is a defence that can
be enforced in both directions, which is the part everybody gets wrong:

  * A name that is tombstoned and then LIVE again is a failure. That is the
    hazard, caught after the fact.
  * A tombstone for a name nobody ever had is ALSO a failure. It is the quieter
    half and it is the one that decays: the entry reserves a string no consumer
    ever generated against, it will block a legitimate future field with that
    name forever, and it reports nothing while it does. A checker that only
    looks for collisions cannot see it, which is why `reserved.surface-missing`
    is a finding of the same severity as the collision it guards.

WHICH IS WHY EACH ENTRY CARRIES A SURFACE. A bare list of names cannot say
whether a name was ever published, so there would be nothing to compare a stale
entry against and the stale-entry check would be unfalsifiable. Each entry names
the contract surface it was removed from, and this checker resolves that surface
in the checkout. A surface that does not resolve is a reservation with nothing
behind it, and `reserved.surface-missing` says so.

THE SAME-SERVICE ANSWER, AND WHY IT IS A FAILURE

A tombstoned name reintroduced **in the service that tombstoned it** is a
FAILURE, not a warning and not a re-reservation. See
`DECISIONS-reserved-tombstone-01.md` for the argument; the short form is that
"it depends" is not an answer a checker can use, and the two available answers
are both bad in the same direction:

  * Allow it, and the reservation means "not right now". A reservation that can
    be spent is not a reservation, and the service that spent it had to
    renegotiate with every consumer by hand — which is the invisible,
    unenforceable part of the hazard, and the reason the rule was worth writing.
  * Forbid it forever with no exit, and a service whose removal was a mistake
    cannot undo it. That is a real cost, and it is the cheapest possible path
    out: the reservation is a line in a version-controlled file, so the
    exception is a diff a reviewer can see, and the alternative is a name that
    can be reused silently.

So the rule is flat — the same verdict in the same service and across services
— and the finding message says which case it is, because "billing reintroduced
its own reserved name" and "courier publishes a name billing reserved" send a
reader to two different files. Same severity, different sentence.

WHAT THIS IS NOT

It does NOT classify diffs. `caf contract breaking` reads two revisions of an
OpenAPI document and decides whether a change is breaking; a second opinion
computed here would be two answers about one diff, which is the exact defect the
tiers exist to prevent. This checker reads DECLARATIONS — a manifest's
tombstone list and the contracts in the checkout — and says whether they agree.

EXIT CODES, THE SAME THREE EVERY CHECKER IN THIS DIRECTORY USES

    0   no finding at severity `fail`.
    1   at least one `fail`.
    2   the check could not happen. Never 0, and never collapsed into 1.

`packaging`: standard library only, on Python 3.9, and it imports exactly one
sibling — `cafaye_contract.read_yaml`, the same import `tenancy_check.py` makes
and for the same reason: a second YAML dialect in this directory would be two
answers about one manifest. No network, ever. No process is run. This checker
reads files and nothing else, which is the property `tenancy_check.py` was
required to earn and this one inherits by construction.
