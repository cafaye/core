WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE FILE
---------------------------
Not tidiness. `harness/cafaye_contract.py` opens by arguing that this must be a
*single* Python file with no dependencies, so a Go service's CI can run it with
nothing installed. That argument is about dependencies, and this file adds none:
it imports the standard library and `cafaye_contract`'s own `Finding`, and it
travels in the same directory, so the "one file a runner must have" property is
unchanged. What the single-file rule does buy is that a rule and its
enforcement cannot drift apart in two places — so the rule lives here, in one
place, and `cafaye_contract.py` reaches it rather than restating it.

It is separated because this packet's work is additive and the file
`cafaye_contract.py` is under active edit by another packet, and because a
resolver is the one piece of this harness a reader will want to read on its own.

IT IS NOT A SECOND DIALECT
--------------------------
`caf/internal/contract/version.go` already resolves these strings, in Go, and
`caf contract resolve` prints the answer. Every function below is a transliteration
of that file, and `harness/tests/core_version_test.sh` pins the rows that
differ. Re-deriving the semantics here would mean a service could be told it is
conforming by the Go tool and nonconforming by this one, and the second one
would be the one that blocks the build.

The rules, in full, so there is nothing left to the reader's memory:

  * A version is `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, three non-negative integers, no prefix,
    no prerelease, no build metadata, and **no leading zero in any component**.
  * A constraint is a version optionally prefixed by `^`, `~` or `>=`. No
    prefix means exactly that version.
  * `^` admits every version that does not change the left-most non-zero
    component. `^1.2.3` is `[1.2.3, 2.0.0)`; `^0.1.0` is `[0.1.0, 0.2.0)`;
    `^0.0.3` is `[0.0.3, 0.0.4)`.
  * `~` pins the minor: `[1.2.3, 1.3.0)`.
  * `>=` is an open-ended floor.
  * An exact constraint is that version and nothing else.

The caret rule for a 0.x release is the load-bearing one and is the reason
this packet exists: before 1.0 the *minor* is the breaking surface, so
`^0.1.0` does not admit `0.2.0`. A service that declares `^0.1.0` and compiles
against 0.2.0 content is compiling against something it said it would not.

WHAT "NO `core:` AT ALL" MEANS
------------------------------
Deliberately not this module's job, and the omission is on purpose. `core` is
listed in `required` by `schemas/cafaye.manifest.schema.json`, so a manifest
that validates has one; absence is `manifest.schema`'s finding, and a second
rule for the same fact would be two rules that could disagree about the same
manifest. `parlor` is the live case — its `cafaye.yml` is a `v0-draft` document
with no `core:` key and a different shape throughout — and it is already
`manifest.schema`'s to report.

`check()` is nonetheless total: handed something that is not a parseable
constraint string it reports `core.constraint-unresolvable` rather than raising.
Defense in depth costs one branch, and a crash in a gate is a worse outcome
than a finding.
