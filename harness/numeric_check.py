WHAT THIS IS FOR

cafaye has one contract and six languages reading it. The hazard this closes
is the class of bug that bites ONE language and not the others: a value that is
correct in the language that wrote it and silently wrong in the language that
read it. JSON.stringify in TypeScript rounds every number through an IEEE-754
binary64, so a Go service that writes 9007199254740993 produces a document
TypeScript cannot represent — Python's int and Ruby's Integer can, so nothing
fails, nothing logs, and the value is wrong. That is precisely what a contract
layer exists to prevent, and nothing in core's checker prevented it.

WHERE THE VOCABULARY LIVES, AND WHY IT IS NOT IN THE SCHEMA

A JSON Schema can say `type: integer`. It cannot ask whether a line of
TypeScript holds an int, whether a Go uint64 survived a JSON round trip, or
whether an enum is one a client may add to. So the four numeric vocabularies
live HERE, in the checker, for the same reason harness/tenancy_check.py keeps
its token vocabularies in the checker rather than in the schema — and that
duplication is a constraint the repo requires to be TESTED, which
test_the_float64_limit_is_stated_once_in_the_checker_and_agrees_with_the_doc
in tests/test_specs.py is.

THE FOUR RULES AND THEIR SEVERITY, each measured before it was written

  numeric.float64-unsafe   FINDING. An integer whose declared maximum reaches
                           the float64 exact range, or an integer with no
                           maximum at all on a field whose name says it carries
                           an identity, must be a string. Zero fields in the
                           fleet violate this today, which is why it can be a
                           failure rather than a warning: a rule that fires on
                           every existing field is a rule that gets disabled.
  numeric.float            WARNING. 3 positions, and all 3 are ratios
                           (slo.objective, slo-windows.factor). A ratio that
                           cannot be a whole number is not a rounding bug.
  numeric.unsigned         NOT ENFORCED. 45 positions, and they are counts,
                           amounts and status codes — the fleet's own
                           vocabulary. See the notEnforced ledger.
  numeric.enum             WARNING. 3 positions. The real cost of a numeric
                           enum is that codegen makes it a closed union, so
                           adding a value is a breaking change in six languages
                           at once — worth saying out loud, not worth failing
                           probes.statusCode over.

WHAT IT IS NOT

It reads documents. It does not read a line of any of the six languages, it
runs no test, and it opens no connection — for the same reason
harness/tenancy_check.py does not: harness/ may not take a dependency or reach
a database. A service's own typed client is what proves that its Go int64
became a TypeScript number; this proves that the CONTRACT did not invite it.

PYTHON 3.9, LIKE harness/tenancy_check.py: no TOML, no packages beyond PyYAML,
and no process. See harness/bin/tenancy-check for why the floor is inherited
rather than raised.
