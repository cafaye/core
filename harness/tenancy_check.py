"""tenancy_check — is a service's account-isolation declaration still true?

    tenancy-check .                       # static: the declaration against the tree

WHAT THIS IS

The platform is sold as self-hostable multi-tenant code. The defect that ends
that product is one customer reading another's data, and measured across the
fleet that defect is invisible from the outside:

    cross-tenant NEGATIVE tests — ones asserting account A is refused account B
    identity 7    courier 19
    billing 0   cafaye-rb 0   cafaye-ts 0   guard 0
    darkroom 0  pantry 0     muse 0        cafaye-py 0

Two services prove isolation. Eight do not, and six of those scope by account
in production code. `darkroom` is the clean case: `assets` and `asset_variants`
carry `account_id uuid not null`, every query reads `where id = $1 and
account_id = $2`, and **zero** tests assert any of it. A refactor that drops
one `and account_id = $2` gives a customer another customer's files and the
whole suite stays green.

SO THE BOUNDARY IS DECLARED, IN `tenancy.yml`, AGAINST THIS SCHEMA

...and declared rather than inferred because inference is what just failed.
Counting account-scoped routes by pattern gives a different answer per
framework:

    guard       route_defs=96     (TypeScript decorators)
    muse        route_defs=76
    cafaye-ts   route_defs=51
    darkroom    route_defs=0      (axum — a different syntax entirely)
    billing     route_defs=0      (Rails — a different syntax entirely)

A grep reporting "darkroom has no routes" when darkroom has account-scoped
queries against customer assets is **worse than no grep**, because it reads
like an answer. So this checker does not count routes. It reads the service's
own enumeration, checks that enumeration against the tree, and says out loud
what it could not classify.

WHAT THE DATABASE DOES ABOUT IT, AND THE ONE RULE THIS FILE EXISTS FOR

The declaration's second half, `rls`, says what Postgres itself does — and the
rule it exists for is one Postgres documents in the CREATE TABLE reference and
NOT in the row-level-security guide, and which **no lint anywhere checks**:

    Postgres does not apply row-level security to a table's OWNER unless the
    table is set FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY.

Supabase's database advisor is the reference for this problem and is worth
reading rather than reinventing. It collects `relforcerowsecurity` — the FORCE
bit — for its dashboard's table list and never judges it (measured:
`packages/pg-meta/src/sql/studio/advisor/lints.ts`). So the realistic bad
outcome is a team that ships policies, enables RLS, and is silently wrong on
exactly the tables a service owns in its own schema, while every gate is green.
Cafaye uses `FORCE` zero times today, which is why this is free to prevent
rather than expensive to retrofit.

    tenancy.rls-owner-bypass   a FAILURE, and the headline of this half.

Everything else in `tenancy.rls-*` is that rule's neighbours, adapted from
advisor lints 0003, 0007, 0008, 0010, 0011, 0016, 0017 and 0024 into static
text checks. `docs/tenancy.md` carries the ledger: every one of the advisor's
twenty-eight lints is marked adopted, adapted or left out, with a reason, and
the exclusions are a test.

CROSS-TENANT ACCESS IS ANSWERED AS NONEXISTENCE

The assertions the two proving services write are about **absence**, not
refusal:

    assert WebhookEndpoints.get(endpoint.id, @other_account_id) == nil
    assert WebhookEndpoints.list(@other_account_id) == []

A `403` tells an attacker the id exists; a `nil`/`[]`/`NotFound` tells them
nothing. So `schemas/tenant-isolation.schema.json` makes `negative.asserts` a
`const: absent`, and `tenancy.denial-refuses` is a FAILURE — if your contract
permits "forbidden" for another account's resource, it has reintroduced an
enumeration oracle, and a test must be able to catch that. See D33.

AND IT IS ANSWERED IN THREE DIRECTIONS, NOT ONE

"The request was refused" is satisfied by a table with no policy at all, by a
table with no predicate at all, and by a service whose database is switched off
— which is the BUG, not the fix. So `negative.cases` is exactly three arms:

    no-identity     nothing is acting             -> zero rows
    other-account   a VALID credential, other one -> zero rows
    own-account     this account's own credential -> ITS ROWS

The third is the load-bearing one. A service that returns nothing to everybody
satisfies the first two, and that is a broken service rather than an isolated
one, so `negative.cases[].asserts` is a `const: present` on that arm:
`tenancy.positive-control-refused` is a FAILURE when the arm is answered with
the language's own spelling of nothing.

WHAT IS PROVED, AND WHAT IS NOT

Four things, and the fourth is the one this packet exists for:

  * every declared entry point names a file that EXISTS and a line that is
    really there — a declaration pointing at nothing is worse than none;
  * the enforcement line still carries the tenancy key, so dropping the
    predicate is a red rather than a refactor;
  * the declared enumeration is CLOSED in both directions, against the SQL the
    scanner can read: a site it finds that nobody declared, and a declaration
    whose site it can no longer find;
  * each entry point's negative assertion is in the service's tests, on the
    line the declaration names, and asserts absence.

And one thing it deliberately does not do: **claim completeness for a language
it cannot read.** `tenancy.enumeration-partial` is a WARNING that names every
declared entry point the scanner could not classify and every account-scope
site it saw and could not attribute, and it says the declaration is not proven
closed. A warning never moves the exit code, so a Go service's CI stays green —
and the report cannot be read as "no routes found".

EXIT CODES

    0   no finding at severity `fail`. Warnings may still be printed.
    1   at least one `fail`.
    2   the check could not happen. Never 0, and never 1: a run that could not
        find the declaration has not checked the boundary, and converting an
        unknown into a green badge is the defect core exists to prevent.

PYTHON 3.9, AND WHY THIS FILE IS NOT 3.11

`harness/gate_check.py` needs 3.11 because it reads `mise.toml` and `tomllib`
is stdlib from 3.11. This one reads no TOML and runs no process, so it runs on
the same floor as `harness/cafaye_contract.py`. That is not a detail: a
contract check that needs an interpreter some service's CI does not have is a
contract check that runs nowhere.

#: What `cafaye.protect_table` writes, as the TEMPLATE resolves it.
#:
#: This is not a second copy of the template and it is not a fork of it: these are
#: the four facts the scanner needs in order to read the ONE call a migration
#: makes, and they are the facts the template already states in its own comments
#: (four policies, one per command, named `<table>_cafaye_<command>`; enable and
#: force, in that order, before any policy). When the template changes shape, the
#: change lands here — a service's migration keeps calling `protect_table` and
#: says nothing about how it is written.
#:
#: `SUBSTRATE_QUALIFIER` is the template's own `qual` local, spelled out because
#: the clause checks read it: the identity is WRAPPED in it, which is the
#: per-row rule passing for the right reason rather than by exemption, and it
#: names `account_id`, which is why it is never an always-true clause.
SUBSTRATE_POLICY_COMMANDS = ("select", "insert", "update", "delete")
SUBSTRATE_POLICY_SUFFIX = "_cafaye_"
SUBSTRATE_IDENTITY = "cafaye.current_account_id()"
SUBSTRATE_QUALIFIER = f"account_id = (select {SUBSTRATE_IDENTITY})"
SUBSTRATE_WRITER = "cafaye.protect_table"

#: What `cafaye.protect_credential_table` writes ON TOP of that, and it is the
#: whole of the difference between the two calls (kit MD24, `fea8052`).
#:
#: One more policy, for ONE command, named `<table>_cafaye_resolve` — which is
#: why this cannot be read as a fifth entry in `SUBSTRATE_POLICY_COMMANDS`: the
#: four are `<command>` and the fifth is not a command. And it is scoped by the
#: value the CALLER PRESENTED, from a transaction-local GUC, rather than by the
#: account. A scanner that assumed `<table>_cafaye_<command>` means the account
#: predicate would read the resolve policy as an account policy, which is a
#: SECOND correction rather than a wider regex — and the wrong one, because the
#: account predicate is a WIDENING here: the resolve policy exists to hold a
#: credential lookup to one row, and scoping it by the account is the table-wide
#: SELECT kit's own comment refuses.
#:
#: `CREDENTIAL_QUALIFIER` is the template's second `qual` local, in its
#: `format('%I = (select cafaye.current_credential_digest())', p_digest_column)`
#: form. The column name is substituted per table, so the qualifier is BUILT and
#: not a constant — which is the second half of what the checker reads out of the
#: call: the digest column is named in the migration and nowhere else, so a call
#: whose second argument is not a string literal says nothing about which column
#: resolves a credential on this table.
CREDENTIAL_POLICY_SUFFIX = "resolve"
CREDENTIAL_POLICY_COMMAND = "select"
CREDENTIAL_IDENTITY = "cafaye.current_credential_digest()"
CREDENTIAL_WRITER = "cafaye.protect_credential_table"

#: Relations row-level security cannot constrain, whatever their policies say.
#: Supabase's `foreign_table_in_api` (0017) and `materialized_view_in_api` (0016)
#: are both this fact, and both are WARNs there because PostgREST reachability is
#: the thing being measured. Here a policy on one of them is a FAILURE: it reads
#: as a boundary and is not one.
UNPROTECTABLE_KINDS = frozenset({"foreign_table", "materialized_view"})

#: A clause that admits every row. Supabase normalises whitespace and compares
#: against exactly these four, and does so for UPDATE, DELETE and ALL only —
#: `USING (true)` on a SELECT is often deliberate public read. **Cafaye has no
#: public read tier**, every table in `rls.tables` is account-scoped by
#: construction, so the SELECT exclusion does not carry over. That is the single
#: place this file raises a lint's severity above the reference, and it is
#: recorded as such in docs/tenancy.md's ledger.
ALWAYS_TRUE_CLAUSES = frozenset({"true", "(true)", "1=1", "(1=1)"})

#: File suffixes the DDL scanner reads. Deliberately narrower than
#: `TEXT_SUFFIXES` above: a `.rb` file may contain SQL, and a `.py` file may
#: contain a migration as a string, and this checker cannot tell which. Anything
#: else carrying row-level-security DDL is named by `tenancy.rls-unreadable`,
#: which is the warning that says *this machine cannot answer* rather than a
#: clean bill of health over a file nobody read.
RLS_SUFFIXES = frozenset({".sql"})

#: What makes a file this scanner cannot parse worth NAMING rather than skipping.
#: Deliberately coarse: the claim `tenancy.rls-unreadable` makes is "there is
#: row-level-security DDL here and this checker cannot parse it", and the honest
#: way to decide that is whether the text mentions row-level security at all. A
#: Rails service's `db/migrate/*.rb` does; its `app/models/*.rb` does not, and
#: naming that one would train a reader to ignore the warning.
_RLS_MARKER = re.compile(

#: The operations the scanner can find in SQL. `call` is not among them by
#: construction — a repository method is a `select` as far as the boundary is
#: concerned and something else as far as a text scanner is concerned — and the
#: schema says so in the same words.
SCANNER_OPERATIONS = frozenset({"select", "update", "delete"})

#: The operations whose denial is a `using` clause, and therefore raises NOTHING.
#:
#: `select` and `delete` have no `with check` — there is no new row to check — so
#: their policies carry only `using` and a cross-tenant attempt matches zero rows
#: silently. `update` is here for the same reason: the `using` clause filters the
#: victim's row out before the write is ever attempted, so the attempt is silent,
#: and an `update` policy's `with check` is only reached by a write that already
#: matched a row the caller owns.
#:
#: `call` is deliberately absent: a repository method's scoping is enforced above
#: the statement and this checker cannot see which clause does the denying, so it
#: has no opinion. Guessing there would be a failure invented rather than caught.
USING_DENIED_OPERATIONS = frozenset({"select", "update", "delete"})

#: The operations that MUTATE an existing row, and so need the victim read back.
#:
#: A denied `update`/`delete` raises nothing and matches nothing, so the row count
#: is the only thing that says it was refused — and the row count is zero for a
#: write that matched nothing for ANY reason, including a bug. Pairing the attempt
#: with a read of the row the attempt targeted is what makes "matched nothing"
#: mean "was refused" rather than "found nothing to do", which is the difference
#: between an assertion and a coincidence.
WRITE_OPERATIONS = frozenset({"update", "delete"})

#: The three spellings of a tenancy key this checker will look for on a declared
#: enforcement line. The fleet has three vocabularies already (D7) and a
#: checker that guessed which one a service uses would be guessing at the
#: boundary rather than at the data. The bare key first, because `account_id`
#: is what four of the services write and the camel spelling is the fallback.
KEY_SPELLINGS = ("{key}", "{key}_", "{key}Id")

#: How far above a tenancy-key line the scanner looks for the operation keyword
#: that names the statement. A SQL statement is routinely wrapped across lines,
#: and attributing the key to the nearest preceding `select`/`update`/`delete`
#: is a bounded rule rather than a guess. Beyond the window the site is
#: reported as a candidate the scanner could not attribute — never guessed at,
#: which is what `tenancy.enumeration-partial` is for.
ATTRIBUTION_WINDOW = 4

#: Directory names never walked. A checker that reads a dependency tree is a

_SQL_COMMENT = re.compile(r"--[^\n]*")

#: Line comments, per file type. Only used to decide whether a line *carries*
#: the tenancy key, so a comment that talks about `account_id` is not an
#: account-scoped statement. Stripping them for that purpose and nothing else is
#: deliberate: a `#` inside a string literal would hide a real site, which is why
#: the fixture's comments are written to avoid the token rather than relying on
#: this being cleverer than it is.
_HASH_COMMENT = re.compile(r"#.*$")
_SLASH_COMMENT = re.compile(r"//.*$")

#: A line that DEFINES the shape rather than reaching a row. `create table
#: assets ( … account_id uuid not null … )` names the tenancy key on the line
#: that declares the column, and skipping to the closing paren is what keeps a
#: schema from being reported as an enumeration of itself.
#:
#: `create function` joined them for the same reason and a worse one: a
#: SECURITY DEFINER helper reads rows, and its predicate line carries the tenancy
#: key, so leaving it in would report the identity function as an undeclared
#: account-scoped statement in every service that adopted this format.
#:
#: The `foreign table` / `materialized view` / `unlogged table` prefixes are here
#: for the same reason: `create foreign table assets (` names `account_id` on the
#: column line three lines down, and a scanner that does not know that is DDL

#: carries the tenancy key, so the entry-point scanner would see it, fail to find
#: a `select … from` on it, and report it through `tenancy.enumeration-partial` —
#: which would make every RLS-aware service permanently warning-shaped and, worse,

#: kit's TWO entry points into row-level security:

#: `select cafaye.protect_credential_table('<table>', '<digest_column>')`.
#:
#: The table name must be a STRING LITERAL. That is the whole boundary of this
#: recognition and it is deliberate in both directions:
#:
#:   * a literal is a fact about the migrations. The scanner is reading the same
#:     text Postgres would run, and a call whose argument is a variable or a
#:     `format(...)` says nothing about which tables it protects — resolving one
#:     would be a guess, and `harness/tenancy_findings.json` says by name that a
#:     guess is not one of this file's products.
#:   * a call it declines to resolve is the SAFE direction. Nothing is claimed,
#:     so the declaration's `<table>_cafaye_<command>` names resolve against
#:     nothing and `tenancy.rls-policy-absent` fires. A scanner that had guessed
#:     would have gone the other way, which is the way this packet's finding was
#:     facing before it was fixed.
#:
#: The schema qualifier is optional because a service may put the substrate in
#: another schema; the function NAME is not, because `protect_table` alone is a
#: name any service could have given something else.
#:
#: WHICH FUNCTION IT IS comes from the NAME and never from the argument list,
#: which is the one subtlety in this pattern. `protect_table('t', 'role')` and
#: `protect_credential_table('t', 'digest')` have the same shape — one string,
#: a comma, another string — and the second argument means a LOGIN ROLE in the
#: first and a DIGEST COLUMN in the second. Reading the second argument to
#: decide which function it is would give `asset_variants` a resolve policy
#: qualified by a string that is a role name, on the substrate fixture the
#: previous packet committed, and `tenancy.rls-undeclared` would fire about a
#: policy the template never wrote. So the function name is matched, the
#: credential spelling is captured as a group, and the second argument is read

    Three questions, in the order they can both apply, and each returns a
    different finding because each wants a different fix:

      1. a `using`-denied arm naming a RAISING token. `select`, `update` and
         `delete` are denied by `using`, which raises nothing — so an exception
         assertion here is asserting a *privilege* failure, and a table with no
         policy at all produces exactly that error. This is the trap the research
         names: the assertion passes while isolation is completely broken.
      2. the positive arm naming a LIVENESS token. `lives_ok` passes when the
         write matched zero rows, which is the same silence wearing a different
         hat, and the third arm exists precisely to separate isolation from a
         service that returns nothing.
      3. a denied WRITE named with an ABSENCE token. An empty result is a lie
         about a row that exists: the other account's row is still there, and
         "nothing came back" claims it is not. This is also the pairing clause —
         `assert_unchanged` and `rows_affected_zero` read the row back, an absent
         result does not, so accepting it is accepting an unpaired denial.

    `operation` is passed in rather than read from the case because it lives on
    the ENTRY POINT: the clause that denies an `update` is a property of the
    statement, not of the assertion about it. An operation this checker has no
    opinion about — `call` — returns `None`, because a check that invented a
    failure where it cannot see the mechanism would be a failure with no cause.

@dataclass
class Policy:
    """One `create policy`, as the migrations wrote it.

    `clause_lines` maps `"using"` and `"with check"` to the line each clause
    OPENS on, because a migration wraps its policies across lines and the
    declaration names one line per clause. The line is the check, for the reason
    `enforced.line` is: a clause that moved is a clause nobody is reading.

    `roles` is empty when the policy names none, which in Postgres means PUBLIC.
    That is kept as an empty tuple rather than being normalised to `("public",)`
    so the message can say the thing that is actually wrong, which is that nothing
    was named.

    `generated` marks a policy that no migration wrote out: it is the one
    `cafaye.protect_table('<table>')` writes, resolved through
    `SUBSTRATE_POLICY_COMMANDS`. Such a policy has no clause on any line of any
    file, so `clause_lines` is empty and `qualifier` carries the template's
    resolved clause body instead — which is why the clause checks below read one
    or the other and never pretend to open a file for a line that is not there.

    `scoped_by` is the identity function the TEMPLATE resolved this policy by,
    and `writer` the function that wrote it. Both exist because of the fifth
    policy `protect_credential_table` adds: it is scoped by
    `CREDENTIAL_IDENTITY` and not by `rls.identity`, and a check that asked "is
    this policy scoped by the identity the declaration names?" without carrying
    the identity it IS scoped by would either demand a widening of the one policy
    that must not be widened, or skip the policy entirely and leave a resolve
    policy scoped by nothing unexamined. `account_policy` is False for that one
    and is the whole exemption: the other four on the same table still have to
    name `rls.identity`, so a credential table is not a table whose account
    policies stop being checked.
