# Event naming

Every event in cafaye travels in the envelope defined by
[`schemas/event-envelope.schema.json`](../schemas/event-envelope.schema.json).
This document is the human half of that contract: the grammar, the reasoning
behind the rules, and the catalog of events that exist today.

**A defect in this document's own tables, named here because the fix and the
check both belong in the same place as the rule.** `identity.user.created`'s
schema required a `usr_`-prefixed id and three optional fields that identity's
only publisher does not emit, where the eight identity schemas beside it said
`format: uuid`. It rejected 100% of the publisher's real output and the suite was
green throughout. It is corrected — `user_id` is a bare uuid and the three fields
are gone — and what stopped it recurring is a rule rather than a reviewer's
memory: [the three checks below](#what-core-checks-against-the-publisher). See
[D35](../DECISIONS.md#d35-identityusercreateds-payload-schema-describes-a-payload-its-only-publisher-does-not-emit)
for the code, the alternatives and the version call.

The machine-checked form of the grammar is the `eventType` pattern in the
schema. `tests/test_specs.py` fails if this document and that pattern ever
disagree.

## Envelope

```json
{
  "specversion": "1.0",
  "id": "0198f1c2-7a41-7c3b-9d55-2f0b6a1e4c88",
  "type": "identity.user.created",
  "source": "identity",
  "subject": "7c1a4e29-8b3d-4f6a-9e05-2d8c1b7a4f63",
  "time": "2026-09-30T04:19:00Z",
  "data": { "user_id": "7c1a4e29-8b3d-4f6a-9e05-2d8c1b7a4f63", "email": "kaka@example.com" }
}
```

| Field | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| `specversion` | Envelope dialect. `1.0` = CloudEvents 1.0 attribute names, cafaye's required subset. Breaking envelope change = new major. |
| `id` | UUID, unique per emission. **Never reused**, including for a retry of the same logical event. Consumers dedupe on this. |
| `type` | The name below. Immutable once published. |
| `source` | Publishing service — must equal `name` in that service's `cafaye.yml`, and the first segment of `type`. CloudEvents' URI form is `/cafaye/<service>`. |
| `subject` | **Required.** The entity the event is *about*, not the actor. Entity id — a bare uuid, e.g. `7c1a4e29-8b3d…`, wherever the entity is the publisher's own row, which is every `identity.*` and `courier.*` event; a third party's own id where the entity is a third party's record, as `billing.subscription.started`'s processor `sub_…` is, named as such in the payload. Or the literal `platform` for an event with no single entity. |
| `time` | RFC3339 UTC, when the state change happened — not when the message was queued. |
| `data` | The payload. Its shape is `schemas/events/<service>/<entity>/<action>.schema.json`, keyed by `type` — see [Payload schemas](#payload-schemas). |

Undeclared envelope attributes are rejected: `additionalProperties` is `false`.
Transport metadata (trace id, hop count, delivery attempt) travels in transport
headers, never in the envelope.

### Why `subject` is required

CloudEvents makes `subject` optional. cafaye does not, because `subject` is what
carries **per-entity ordering**: a consumer that needs two events about the same
thing in order correlates on this value and nothing else. An absent `subject` is
a correlation key that silently disappeared, and the resulting bug is a state
machine that only fails under replay.

An event with no single entity — a nightly billing reconciliation, a fleet-wide
config reload — is not exempt from the field; it uses the literal `platform`.
A required field with a reserved value is a value a consumer can always read, a
missing field is a null check every consumer has to remember to write.

## Grammar

Every event type is `<service>.<entity>.<action>` — three segments, always
prefixed, no exceptions.

```
type    := <service> "." <entity> "." <action>             # exactly 3 segments
segment := lowercase snake_case, starts with a letter      # [a-z][a-z0-9]*(_[a-z0-9]+)*
service := cafaye namespace name — kebab-case, may contain a dash
```

1. **Three segments, always prefixed.** `<service>` is the publishing service and
   must equal the envelope's `source` and the manifest's `name`.
   `<entity>` is the aggregate the event is about, singular, lowercase
   snake_case. `<action>` is what happened to it. There is no short form:
   `identity.api_key.created`, not `api_key.created`.
2. **The prefix is not optional, and that is the point.** An unprefixed type
   says only what changed, never who changed it, so every consumer — a
   subscription, a `guard` route, an SDK's generated constant, a human reading a
   log line at 3am — has to join it against a table of publishers. Prefixing
   every type makes the publisher part of the name, which is what lets a type be
   routed, generated and fanned out from the string alone. The verbosity is the
   price and it is worth paying once per type rather than at every subscription.
3. **Segment casing is not uniform, and that is deliberate.** The service segment
   is a service name, so it is kebab-case like `name` in a manifest
   (`email-sender.email.queued`); the entity and action segments are snake_case
   (`identity.api_key.created`). A service name never contains an underscore, so
   an underscore in the first segment is always a mistake.
4. **Actions are past tense or state, never commands.** `created`, `deleted`,
   `invited`, `started`, `succeeded`, `bounced`, `past_due`, `revoked`.
   Never `on_user_created`, `user_create`, `UserCreated`, `users`, `is_active`.
5. **One event, one fact.** If you need `and`, you need two events.
6. **Immutability.** A published type never changes meaning. `type` is not a
   version field; `specversion` and the payload schema carry evolution.


## Action vocabulary

Stick to this list for v0; anything else is a manager decision.

`created` · `updated` · `deleted` · `verified` · `enabled` · `disabled` ·
`revoked` · `regenerated` · `invited` · `joined` · `removed` · `role_changed` ·
`started` · `updated` · `canceled` · `past_due` · `succeeded` · `failed` ·
`refunded` · `recorded` · `queued` · `delivered` · `bounced` · `complained` ·
`suppressed` · `requested` · `completed` · `consumed`

## Evolution

| Change | Move |
| --- | --- |
| New optional `data` field | Same `type`. Preferred; consumers must ignore unknown fields. |
| New required `data` field | Same `type` only if consumers can tolerate it missing; otherwise a new `type`. |
| Field renamed, removed, or semantics changed | **New `type`.** Publish both, deprecate the old one, never repurpose it. |
| Breaking envelope change | Bump `specversion`. |

Deprecation is announced in the catalog below with a `deprecated` row and a
removal date, at least **6 months** out — the same window as the HTTP API
([openapi-conventions.md](openapi-conventions.md)).

Because a payload schema lives in core, evolving one is a core release, and it
follows [README.md's bump table](../README.md#spec-versioning): a new optional
field is a patch, a new required field is a minor, and a removed or retyped field
is a major. A publisher that wants to make a breaking payload change ships a new
`type` and deprecates the old one; it does not edit the schema in place and hope
the consumers read the diff.

## The fleet declaration

The catalog is only as true as the thing it is compared against. Until
[`fleet.yml`](../fleet.yml) landed, that thing was core's own
`examples/valid/*.cafaye.yml` — which core also writes, so the assertion could
only ever catch core disagreeing with itself. A real service could advertise any
event type at all.

`fleet.yml` is the other side of the comparison: a machine-readable record, per
service repository, of what that service's own `cafaye.yml` declares on `master`,
with the full commit each one was read at and the day it was read. It is
validated by [`schemas/fleet.schema.json`](../schemas/fleet.schema.json), and
`tests/test_specs.py` asserts, for every entry:

- the service is named (dropping one fails, rather than silencing the checks)
- every published type satisfies the grammar and starts with its own service name
- every catalog row for a shipped service is accounted for by exactly one of
  `events`, `cataloguedOnly` or `pendingCoreContract`, and the three are pairwise
  disjoint
- every type in `pendingCoreContract` is a debt core really owes — no catalog row
  in this document, or no payload schema under `schemas/events/`
- a service that records an `api` document may not carry a note denying one
- every service records a full `sourceCommit` on `master`

Two more apply to the declaration as a whole, and both are about the record
rather than about any one service: the suite's gate floor rises with the suite,
and the catalog this document holds is asserted against the manifests core
writes. The first is why adding a test here fails the gate until
[`gate.yml`](../gate.yml)'s `minimum` is raised in the same commit; the second is
the weaker comparison this file exists to strengthen, and it is still weaker than
a real manifest.

**Every published type has a catalog row *and* a payload schema**, checked in
both directions. That condition is now MET for the first time — all 23 types in
`fleet.yml`'s `events` have both halves, which is what let identity's nine move
out of `pendingCoreContract` — and the assertion is what says a type core has not
finished belongs in `pendingCoreContract` rather than in `events`. It is the
assertion courier's five types would have failed the day they were declared; see
[D34](../DECISIONS.md#d34-how-does-the-fleet-record-a-type-core-has-not-finished-contracting-for).

`manifestViolations` was courier's five two-segment types. They are transcribed,
not catalogued: naming a non-conforming type in the catalog would not make it
valid, and the fix belongs to the publisher. **The list is now empty**, because
the fix landed — courier's `cafaye.yml` declares all five in the conforming form
and `Courier.Events.types/0` was corrected with it — and the deletion is the
acknowledgement. It is recorded here because a reader who remembers the list and
not the deletion will read the absence as a missing check, and the check is now
the one that says a type in `events` has both halves.

`events`, `cataloguedOnly` and `pendingCoreContract` are three different lists on
purpose. A catalog row is a promise and a manifest entry is a claim;
`cataloguedOnly` is a promise nobody has kept, and `pendingCoreContract` is a
promise a service kept that core has not answered. **Identity was the live
example of all three at once**: its manifest declares nine conforming types, and
core shipped a row and a schema for exactly one of them, so all three lists were
non-empty and the largest said something unflattering about core. **All three are
still live, and identity is no longer the example.** Its nine types moved to
`events` when core paid the debt — eight payload schemas, read out of the
publisher's own event builders, plus two catalog rows for the OIDC registrations
that had none at all — and what remains on both sides is the honest half: the
five `cataloguedOnly` types core has promised and identity does not declare, and
the five types identity's code emits and its manifest does not declare.
Collapsing the lists would either empty the catalog of promises or make every
promise a lie.

**`caf contract lint` reads this file** rather than re-deriving the catalog, so
there is one answer to "what does the fleet publish" rather than two derivations
that can disagree.

## Delivery

- At-least-once. `id` is the dedupe key; every consumer stores it and makes its
  handler idempotent before it goes to production. Duplicates are not an edge
  case to be tolerated, they are the normal case.
- Ordering is per-entity only, never global. If a consumer needs two events in
  order, it correlates on `subject`.
- A consumer that cannot process an event must not block the queue: park it,
  alert, keep going.
- Publishing is a transactional outbox, not a best-effort `PUBLISH` in a request
  handler. The table, the publisher loop and the retry rules are in
  [event-outbox.md](event-outbox.md).

## Catalog

Every event that exists today. A type becomes real when it has a row here and
an entry in its publisher's `exposes.events` — the two are asserted to agree in
both directions by `tests/test_specs.py`, so a row without a publisher entry (or
the reverse) fails the suite. Registering a new one is a five-step checklist at
the bottom of this document.

### identity

Emitted by `identity`. Listed in `examples/valid/go-api.cafaye.yml`.

| Event type | Subject | Emitted when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `identity.user.created` | the user | Signup completes, before email verification. |
| `identity.user.email_verified` | the user | The verification link is redeemed. |
| `identity.account.created` | the account | A new account/tenant is provisioned. |
| `identity.member.invited` | the account | An invitation is sent. `data.invitation_id` is the thing to act on. |
| `identity.member.joined` | the account | An invitation is accepted. |
| `identity.member.removed` | the account | A member is removed or declines. |
| `identity.member.role_changed` | the account | A role is granted or revoked. `data` carries old and new role. |
| `identity.mfa.enabled` | the user | TOTP enrolled and confirmed. Fires for the first enrollment and for every rotation after it, which are the same fact: a second factor is live for this user now. |
| `identity.mfa.disabled` | the user | MFA turned off by the user with a valid factor of their own. There is no other way to reach it from identity. |
| `identity.session.revoked` | the user | Every credential a user holds is ended by one of identity's own flows: a password reset, or an email address change, and `data.reason` is the closed set of those two. **A single logout is not this event** — `DELETE /v1/session` ends one session and emits nothing, and identity has no admin revocation, so a subscriber may read this type as "this account's credentials are all gone" with no field telling it so. |
| `identity.api_key.created` | the api key | A scoped API token is issued. The entity `api_key` is generic, but so is the prefix — every type carries one. The subject is the credential's **own row id**, and `data` carries no id for it, so a consumer joins the pair on `subject`. |
| `identity.api_key.revoked` | the api key | A scoped API token is withdrawn. The row's own wording is *revoked or expired*; identity has no sweeper, so only the withdrawal is emitted today and the expiry arrives with the code that produces it. |
| `identity.oidc_client.created` | the oidc client | A product registers itself as an OpenID Connect relying party. The subject is the registration's **row id**, not the `client_id` string the relying party presents at the token endpoint: a consumer that has to stop trusting a credential correlates on the credential. `data` carries the grant itself — the redirect URIs, the grant types and the scopes — because "a client exists" does not say what it may do. |
| `identity.oidc_client.revoked` | the oidc client | A registration stops being honoured. The same transaction bulk-revokes every access token issued against it, because a signed JWT is verifiable by anybody holding the published key set until its `exp` arrives and revoking the registration alone is not enough; the row is kept rather than deleted, so an audit of which credentials existed survives. |

### billing

Emitted by `billing`. Listed in `examples/valid/ruby-api.cafaye.yml`.

Three of these payloads are the publisher's own rows read straight out — the
customer, the plan — and five are normalised from a payment processor's webhook.
That distinction is in every one of them: `processor` and `processor_event_id`
say where the fact came from, so a consumer can tell a fact billing knows from a
fact billing was told. It is also why none of them carries a cafaye-prefixed
`sub_…`, `pln_…` or `acc_…` id: billing has no table of its own for any of the
three, and an id it did not mint it cannot send. That much still holds. What does
not hold is the half of **D10** that said billing *cannot* have such fields at all
— **billing has grown a `subscriptions` table since**, and
`Subscriptions::Lifecycle#core_payload/1` (`app/services/subscriptions/lifecycle.rb:353`)
now writes `plan_id` and `account_id` as **bare uuids** onto all three
subscription payloads, which core's schemas for those three types do not name.
The disagreement is recorded, with its evidence, in
[D39](../DECISIONS.md#d39-does-a-payload-schema-follow-its-publisher-when-the-publisher-has-grown-the-feature-the-schema-predicted-it-would-not)
and in each of those schemas' own `$comment`; it runs in both directions, and
core's claims about it were corrected in this packet rather than left standing.

| Event type | Subject | Emitted when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `billing.plan.created` | the plan | A plan is published and becomes billable. |
| `billing.plan.updated` | the plan | A published plan changes: its price, interval, trial or active flag. |
| `billing.customer.created` | the customer | A billing customer is created for an account. |
| `billing.subscription.started` | the subscription | A subscription becomes active (trial counts as started). |
| `billing.subscription.updated` | the subscription | Plan, quantity, or interval changes. |
| `billing.subscription.canceled` | the subscription | Cancellation takes effect, not when requested. |
| `billing.subscription.past_due` | the subscription | A payment attempt fails; the grace period starts. |
| `billing.payment.succeeded` | the payment | A charge settles. **Money events only; integer minor units.** Emitted from two sources with two payload shapes — invoice-backed and one-time Checkout — and the schema makes that a `oneOf` rather than an optional-everything. See [D11](../DECISIONS.md#d11-billingpaymentsucceeded-has-two-payload-shapes). |
| `billing.payment.failed` | the payment | A charge attempt is declined or errors. `data.amount` is what could **not** be collected, never what was. |
| `billing.payment.refunded` | the payment | A refund settles, full or partial. |
| `billing.invoice.created` | the invoice | A finalized invoice exists. |
| `billing.usage.recorded` | the account | Metered usage is accepted for a period; `data` carries quantity + window. |

### courier

Emitted by `courier`. Listed in `examples/valid/worker.cafaye.yml`.

| Event type | Subject | Emitted when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `courier.email.queued` | the notification | **Not emitted.** courier declares the type and has no builder for it, so it is **declared-and-unimplemented** — see [D38](../DECISIONS.md#d38-does-a-declared-event-type-with-no-builder-stay-in-core-or-leave). The sentence this row used to carry ("a message is accepted for delivery; emitted on acceptance, not on send, so a queue backlog is visible") described a queue courier does not have: its send path is synchronous and the provider is dialled inside the request. A consumer subscribing here waits forever, and that is the recorded state rather than an oversight. |
| `courier.email.delivered` | the notification | The provider accepts the message. |
| `courier.email.bounced` | the notification | The destination hard-bounces. Suppresses further sends to that address. |
| `courier.email.complained` | the notification | The recipient marked it as spam. Suppresses the address immediately. |
| `courier.notification.suppressed` | the recipient | A send was skipped: preference off, address suppressed, or rate limited. The audit trail for a message that was never sent. No `message_id` in the payload, because there was no message — see [D8](../DECISIONS.md#d8-what-is-the-subject-of-couriernotificationsuppressed). |

All five are the conforming spellings, **and all five are what courier's own
manifest now says** — `exposes.events` at courier's `master` reads
`courier.email.queued`, `courier.email.delivered`, `courier.email.bounced`,
`courier.email.complained` and `courier.notification.suppressed`, and
`Courier.Events.types/0` was corrected to match. It used to say `email.queued`
and four siblings, which core v0.2's frozen grammar rejected; that is why
[`fleet.yml`](../fleet.yml) has a `manifestViolations` list at all, and the list
is now **empty**, because the fix landed and deleting the entry is the
acknowledgement. See [the fleet declaration](#the-fleet-declaration).

Declaring a type and emitting it are different facts, and this catalog does not
claim the second. **As of 2026-10-02 courier publishes four of its five.**
`email.delivered` from the send path, `bounced` and `complained` from the inbound
webhook that also writes the suppression row, and `notification.suppressed` from
the one-click unsubscribe endpoint — `Courier.Unsubscribes.publish/1` writes its
`outbox_events` row in the same transaction as the suppression it belongs to,
using `Courier.Events.suppressed_type/0` so the row and the envelope cannot
drift, and its payload is field-for-field the four fields
`schemas/events/courier/notification/suppressed.schema.json` already requires.
`email.queued` has no builder and no caller, for the reason its catalog row gives.
The registry's per-service notes carry the evidence and the commits.

Every courier payload keys its recipient on a bare uuid, and so does every
identity payload beside it, and the two join. **They did not, for a while, and
the reason is worth carrying:** courier was right and
[`identity.user.created`](../schemas/events/identity/user/created.schema.json) was
wrong — it required a `usr_`-prefixed id that identity has never emitted. The
mismatch was [D7](../DECISIONS.md#d7-courier-keys-a-user-by-uuid-and-identity-publishes-a-usr_-id),
whose second half asserted the false half as fact, and it was
[D35](../DECISIONS.md#d35-identityusercreateds-payload-schema-describes-a-payload-its-only-publisher-does-not-emit)
that corrected it. Nothing in core compared the two schemas; the contradiction
became visible only because a second schema was written next to the first.

### muse

Emitted by `muse`. Listed in `examples/valid/muse.cafaye.yml`.

| Event type | Subject | Emitted when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `muse.tokens.consumed` | `platform` | One routed completion is metered. The subject is core's reserved literal rather than an id: a call belongs to one request, and muse's v1 auth stub does not read a token, so there is no account to name. See [D9](../DECISIONS.md#d9-consumed-is-not-in-the-action-vocabulary-and-the-payload-has-no-account). |

## Payload schemas

Every event's `data` has a schema, and it lives in **core**, not in the
publishing repository. The path is the event type with dots turned into
directory separators, so a type needs no index to be found:

```
identity.user.created  ->  schemas/events/identity/user/created.schema.json
```

Core owns the single home because a payload schema is a promise to *other*
services. The moment a publisher can change it in a commit nobody downstream
sees, the contract is whatever the publisher's tests happen to assert, and every
consumer's SDK generator is reading a file with a different lifetime. A schema
that lives in core is versioned, diffed and released with the event catalog it
belongs to, which is what makes `identity.user.created` a citable contract
rather than a moving target.

**A payload schema describes what a publisher emits, not what it ought to emit.**
Every field in every file below was read out of the publisher's code on the day it
was written, and a field no publisher sends is left out rather than guessed — a
schema that names a field nobody emits is worse than no schema, because it is a
contract that lies and it lies *green*. Where a publisher has not written the code
yet, the payload carries only the fields that are already derivable from the
type, and what is missing is written down in
[DECISIONS.md](../DECISIONS.md) rather than filled in with a plausible guess.
`courier.email.bounced` has no provider diagnostic because courier has no receiver
for one; `muse.tokens.consumed` has no account because muse's auth stub does not
read a token. `identity.user.created` had an `email_verified`, a `locale` and an
`account_ids` that identity's builder has never filled, and they were **deleted
rather than left optional** — optional is the same lie in a softer form, and the
example is the thing a consumer copies.

The cost is churn: core gains a commit every time a payload changes. That is the
cost of a contract being a contract, and it is paid in review rather than in
debugging a consumer that broke on a Tuesday.

### What core checks against the publisher

Core cannot import Go, and a rule it states and cannot enforce is a rule that
lies — so this section is the honest inventory of what the three checks below
decide, and each one is in `tests/test_specs.py` with the file it was written for
as its witness.

1. **One publisher spells one id one way.** Every identifier field — `user_id`,
   `account_id`, `client_id`, the envelope's `subject`, anything named `*_id` —
   carries the same `format`/`pattern`/`enum`/`const` in every payload schema of
   the same service. A ninth schema written from an assumption goes red against
   the eight that were read out of a publisher's code. *This is the check D35
   existed to need.* It does not compare requiredness or nullability, because
   billing's `subscription_id` is a required string on one event and a nullable
   one on another and that is two true facts rather than a disagreement.
2. **No id shape that no publisher mints.** A short lowercase prefix, an
   underscore and a long run of uppercase base32 — a ULID behind a prefix — is
   not something any publisher in the fleet produces, so no schema may require
   one and no valid example may show one. It is a shape rather than a list of
   prefixes on purpose: `sub_` is a prefix cafaye does not mint and Stripe mints
   on every subscription, so a prefix list would have gone red on a true fact.
3. **A schema cites the commit its publisher was read at.** identity's nine
   payload schemas each name it in their `$comment`, and it is the commit
   `fleet.yml` records as identity's `sourceCommit` — so re-reading a publisher
   turns its payload schemas red until somebody re-reads those too. Courier's
   five and billing's eight now carry the same obligation, every one read at the
   commit `fleet.yml` already records for its service.
4. **Every example's ids are the ids the service that emits it mints.** The
   denylist in 2 is a negative, and a negative only catches what it is pointed
   at — which is how twenty-one examples under `examples/valid/telemetry/` and
   `examples/valid/events/billing/` carried a prefixed ULID for the whole of
   core-24 with that rule green. So each producer's id type is transcribed from a
   named file at a named commit into a ledger, and every identifier value in
   every valid example must match the shape recorded for that field of that
   service. The walk is in both directions: a recorded shape no example exercises
   is a fault too. [`D37`](../DECISIONS.md#d37-how-does-core-check-that-an-examples-ids-are-the-ids-its-producer-mints)
   is the decision and the evidence — including why `tenant_id` is an operator
   label rather than an id, and why `account_id` is real on a payload and emitted
   by nobody on a telemetry resource.

**What none of them can do, stated here so nobody has to infer it:** core reads
no publisher and reaches no network, so none of these proves that a schema
describes the code it claims to have been read from. They compare core against
core — a schema against its siblings, against a fleet-wide id vocabulary, and
against core's own record of which commit was read. That catches a lone schema
that drifted and a stale citation, and it cannot catch a publisher whose code
changed without anybody re-reading it. The only check that would is a publisher-
side one, in each service's own repository, and
[D36](../DECISIONS.md#d36-what-a-static-check-can-say-about-a-publisher-core-has-never-read)
is the decision about what core owes instead of pretending.

Each payload schema is a standalone draft 2020-12 document, closed with
`additionalProperties: false` like every other schema here, and it validates the
`data` object — not the envelope around it. The envelope is validated separately
by [`schemas/event-envelope.schema.json`](../schemas/event-envelope.schema.json);
a contract test does both, in that order. A type with more than one real payload
shape gets a `oneOf` and one valid example per shape, rather than a schema that
validates all of them and cannot tell them apart — `billing.payment.succeeded` is
the only one today.

The rest of the catalog has no payload schema yet; each lands with the packet
that first needs it. **Nine rows are owed one** — identity's five tenancy events
and billing's four — and all nine are catalogued promises nobody publishes yet,
which is the `cataloguedOnly` half of the story above rather than a hole in this
table. `tests/test_specs.py` fails on a payload schema that is not
in this table, and on a table row whose file does not exist, so the two cannot
drift. `test_every_payload_schema_owes_a_negative_case` closes the third gap: a
schema in this table with no entry in `INVALID_PAYLOAD_CASES` proves nothing,
because nothing asserts it rejects anything.

**A negative case is where a schema earns its keep, and the eight identity rows
are the worked example of why.** The boilerplate is a payload missing a required
field and carrying one the schema never declared, which proves the object is
closed and nothing else. Four of these eight trip something more: a `reason`
outside identity's two, a `method` the `mfa_credentials` CHECK forbids, a scope
outside the vocabulary. Those are the constraints read out of the publisher's
code rather than out of the type's name, and a case that only omitted a required
field would have passed with none of them present. The same reasoning picks the
undeclared field in each case: a verification token, an `otpauth://` URI, an api
key's plaintext, an OIDC client secret, a `revoke_reason`. Those are the fields
the publisher's own comments say it deliberately does not emit, so each negative
example is an *enforced* version of a sentence in a Go docstring in another
repository — which is the most a contract written by somebody who did not ship
the publisher can be.

`billing.customer.created`'s `metadata` is the one object in the repository that
is deliberately **not** closed — it is a free-form bag, and a closed bag would be
a bag that can hold nothing. It is named as the exception in its own description
([D12](../DECISIONS.md#d12-metadata-is-the-one-deliberately-open-object)).

## Registering a new event

1. Pick the type from the grammar and the action vocabulary.
2. Add it to the publisher's `cafaye.yml` `exposes.events`.
3. Add a row to the publisher's catalog sub-section above, with its payload
   fields. Steps 2 and 3 are the same fact stated twice — the suite fails if
   only one of them happens, so land them in one commit.
4. Add the payload schema at
   `schemas/events/<service>/<entity>/<action>.schema.json`, with a valid
   example under `examples/valid/events/`, a negative one under
   `examples/invalid/events/` and a row in the table above.
5. Add a contract test: the emitted envelope validates against the envelope
   schema, and the payload against the payload schema.

If the payload's real shape cannot be determined — because the publisher's code
does not say, or says two things — **do not guess a field name.** A schema that
names a field nobody emits is worse than no schema: it is a contract that lies.
Leave the property out, and record the question in
[DECISIONS.md](../DECISIONS.md) as a numbered decision with a call, the
alternatives, a recommendation and the cost of flipping (see
[D6](../DECISIONS.md#d6-where-do-open-decisions-live) for why the numbering lives
there rather than in this file). A shipped schema and an open question are both
fine; a confident wrong field is neither.
