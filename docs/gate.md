# docs/gate.md — how a cafaye repository declares its gate

**The rule.** A repository declares its gate in a file called `gate.yml` at its
root, written against [`schemas/gate.schema.json`](../schemas/gate.schema.json)
and checked against the repository by
[`harness/gate_check.py`](../harness/gate_check.py). A gate that has to be
discovered by getting it wrong is not a gate.

## Why this file exists

Measured across the fifteen repositories in the cafaye workspace, there were
five different spellings of "run the gate":

| Spelling | Repositories |
| --- | --- |
| `mise run prime` | billing, caf, cafaye-rb, courier, darkroom, docs, identity, pantry, parlor (9) |
| `mise x -- ./bin/prime` — a `bin/prime` and **no `[tasks]` section at all** | guard, muse (2) |
| a mise task named `test`, not `prime` | core (1) |
| `bash tests/validate.sh` — no `mise.toml` and no `bin/` at all | kit (1) |
| a mise task named `gate` whose `run` names a file that does not exist | cafaye-py (1) |

And two of the three times the gate was run badly in this fleet, it went green
while failing:

- `… | tail -45; echo "PRIME EXIT=$?"` under **zsh**, which has no
  `PIPESTATUS`. `$?` was the exit code of `tail`, which is always 0. The log
  said `FAIL github.com/cafaye/identity/internal/users 604.552s`; the shell
  said `PRIME EXIT=0`; the only thing that caught it was a person reading the
  log, which is not a mechanism.
- `kit` was dispatched with the fleet-standard gate, in a repository with no
  `bin/`. The command named in the packet could never have run.

And the third failure was not a mistake at all, it was a gap: identity's
`bin/prime` does not migrate the database. A gate that creates a database and
does not migrate it is a suite that is entirely green against an empty schema —
1430 tests proving they do not notice an empty database. Recovering it cost one
604-second run.

Those are three mistakes wearing three coats. It is one mistake: **the gate is
discovered by failure instead of declared.** `wavecheck.sh` already encodes the
same lesson for worker liveness — *the roster is discovered, not maintained* —
and its own comment records that three earlier versions of it were wrong. The
fix there was to stop maintaining the roster by hand.

## Why not mise tasks alone

This is the incumbent, generalised: nine of the fifteen repositories already do
it, and it works well as a **runner**. Measured here, in this repository:

```
$ mise tasks
prime  The gate: validate every example against the core schemas (bin/prime)
setup  Create tests/.venv and install the validator dependencies
test   Alias for `mise run prime`; kept so existing muscle memory and scripts still work
```

mise can be made to give a machine the *list* of tasks. What it cannot do is
hold the three things this packet needs:

1. **External requirements.** `[tasks.prime] run = "bin/prime"` has nowhere to
   say that `bin/prime` needs an interpreter and one fetch from PyPI on a cold
   checkout. The honest answer today lives in a comment at the top of
   `mise.toml`, and a comment is not checkable — which is the entire
   uncomfortable history of identity's unmigrated database.
2. **Whether a gate ran.** A task is a command. Nothing in mise can tell
   `bin/prime` that ran 140 tests apart from `true`.
3. **Agreement with CI.** A task and a workflow are two files in two languages
   describing one gate, and mise has no opinion about whether they still agree.

So a mise task stays, and it stays the thing you run. What it cannot hold is a
**declaration**, and the objection to mise-alone is not that mise is bad — it is
that a task is a *claim* and this format is the one thing in the repository that
can be **checked**.

## Why not a CI-only declaration

kit already publishes `ci.reusable.yml`, and a GitHub Actions job *is* a
machine-readable statement of how a repository is gated. Measured, in the
fifteen repositories: thirteen have a workflow, and the two that do not
(`docs`, `cafaye-py`) are exactly the two whose gate nobody can find. That is
the argument for it.

It is rejected for two reasons, and the first is structural:

1. **A workflow cannot be run.** `gh` is not on a developer's machine, a
   workflow is not a local command, and the question this format exists to
   answer — *what gates this repository* — has to be answerable with nothing
   installed. A developer who has to push a branch to find out what the gate is
   has already lost.
2. **The local gate and the CI gate can then drift, and nothing sees it.** The
   two are separate files in separate languages with separate syntaxes. There is
   no relationship between them to assert. A CI-only declaration cannot detect
   that CI stopped running the gate, because CI *is* the declaration — there is
   no second copy to disagree with. This is measurable in this fleet: twelve of
   the fifteen declare a `gate` job, and `darkroom`'s runs `./bin/prime --db`
   while its local task runs `./bin/prime`, so the local gate and the CI gate are
   **already two different gates** in the same repository, and neither one says
   so.

The two are complements, and the format takes the part of each that is
checkable. `ci.workflow` + `ci.invokes` in `gate.yml` is checked *against* the
workflow, so the drift above becomes `gate.ci-disagrees` rather than a fact
nobody notices.

## Why not a second task runner

Because the fleet already has three spellings and this would be a fourth. A
declaration that *runs* things is a task runner, and adopting one is adopting
the maintenance of one. So: this is **not a task runner**, and the distinction
is not a naming preference. `gate.yml` declares; `mise` and `bin/prime` run.
The checker has exactly one job — compare the declaration to the tree — and the
one time it runs anything is when you ask it to prove the gate, which is a
question about a gate, not a way to gate.

## The format

`gate.yml`, at the repository root. Four required keys and one optional.

Three questions about this format are open, and the manager rules on them:
**D30** — a proof, or only a description of the gate
([DECISIONS.md](../DECISIONS.md#d30-the-gate-declaration-names-an-argv-and-the-checker-runs-it));
**D31** — 3.11 for this checker where the contract harness accepts 3.9
([DECISIONS.md](../DECISIONS.md#d31-the-gate-checker-is-stdlib-only-and-needs-python-311-where-the-contract-harness-needs-39));
**D32** — whether a repository with no CI is a warning or a failure
([DECISIONS.md](../DECISIONS.md#d32-whether-a-repository-with-no-ci-is-a-warning-or-a-failure)).

```yaml
version: 1
name: core

gate:
  command: [bin/prime]          # an argv. What a person or a tool runs.
  miseTask: prime               # `mise run <task>` must resolve to `entrypoint`
  entrypoint: bin/prime         # a repository-relative path; must exist, be executable
  timeoutSeconds: 900
  proof:
    - id: suite                 # what "the gate ran" looks like
      match: '^([0-9]+)/[0-9]+ passed$'
      minimum: 140              # a floor, read from group 1

external:
  selfContained: false
  requirements:
    - kind: network             # database | service | toolchain | credential | network | filesystem
      name: PyPI, ONCE, on a cold checkout
      satisfy:
        command: [tests/setup.sh]
        unmet: tests/.venv/bin/python does not exist

ci:
  workflow: .github/workflows/ci.yml
  invokes: [bin/prime]
```

Three choices in there are load-bearing and each has a reason.

**An argv, never a shell string.** A command is a list of arguments, so the
first one is a file or a PATH name and nothing in it is a shell metacharacter.
The schema refuses `| & ; < > ( ) $ backtick ' " * ? { } [ ] # ~` and a newline
in any argument, and allows `= , : @ + %` and spaces. A gate argument never
legitimately needs the first set; a real one routinely needs the second
(`postgres://u:p@localhost:5432/db` is a perfectly ordinary argument). The
`examples/invalid/gate.shell-string.yml` file is the exact command that produced
this fleet's false green, and the schema refuses it.

**A proof, or the declaration is the false green written down.** `match` is a
Python regular expression applied with `re.MULTILINE` to the gate's combined
stdout and stderr, **with terminal escapes stripped** — see
[the output is matched colour-free](#the-output-is-matched-colour-free) below,
which is a rule with a consequence and not a detail. A run that exits 0 without
emitting every declared proof is `gate.proof-missing`, and it is a **failure**.
`minimum` is read from the pattern's single capture group, and it is a
**decrease-detector**: a suite that quietly lost forty tests cannot report itself
as passing. `1/1 passed` and `3/3 passed` are the same claim without it.

Two proofs is how two tiers stay separately countable. A repository with a unit
tier and a database tier declares both; a run in which only the first appeared
is `gate.proof-missing`, which is a different and more honest thing than "a
green with a smaller number in it".

## The output is matched colour-free

**Write your `match` patterns against the line a terminal SHOWS, not the bytes a
log holds.** The checker removes ANSI escape sequences from the gate's captured
output before it applies any `proof[].match`, so `^[ ]*Tests[ ]+([0-9]+) passed`
is the right pattern for `vitest` even though the captured line begins with
`\x1b[2m` and not with a space.

This is not a convenience. It was a false red on the first repository to adopt
this format with a colourising runner: the suite really ran and really printed
`Tests  377 passed`, the declared pattern could not match the escaped bytes, and
core answered `gate.proof-missing` about a gate that had just proved — in the
same log — that it ran 377 tests.

The reason the fix lives here and not in the declaration is the point of the
format. The alternative is `NO_COLOR=1` in the gate, or an escape-tolerant regex
in each repository. Both make the **gate** or the **declaration** carry the cost
of a defect in the **checker**, and the first quietly changes what a developer
sees when they run the gate by hand. This is one place, in the checker.

Stripping happens in `harness/gate_check.py`, once, where the output is read.

### What is stripped

| Sequence | Shape | Emitted by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CSI** | `ESC [ … final`, and 8-bit `0x9b` | SGR colour, cursor moves, erase-line, private modes — `vitest`, `cargo test`, `pytest`, `go test`, colour-enabled `mix test` |
| **OSC** | `ESC ] … BEL` or `ESC ] … ST`, and 8-bit `0x9d` | window titles (OSC 0/2), hyperlinks (OSC 8) |
| **DCS** | `ESC P … ST` | device control, wrapped payloads |
| **two-character** | `ESC ( B`, `ESC 7`, … | charset selection, keypad mode |

**Not handled, deliberately: an unterminated sequence.** A string sequence with
no terminator is left in place rather than consumed to end-of-input. The
tempting alternative consumes everything after it — including the proof line —
and turns an absent proof into a green, which is the exact class of defect this
format exists to end. A gate that leaves a sequence unterminated is malformed,
and a malformed gate is allowed to fail loudly. If you hit this, the fix is in
the gate's runner flags, not in a wider regex.

The gate's **log keeps the raw bytes**. Stripping applies to matching only: the
log is the operator's evidence, and a log that disagreed with the output it
records would be a worse lie than the one being fixed.

### What stripping does to a pattern

Stripping **can broaden a pattern**, and it is worth knowing how, because the
summary ("colour carries no assertion, so nothing is weakened") is reassuring
until you know the mechanism. Two consequences, both real:

1. **An anchored pattern can reach a line it could not reach.** `^` binds to the
   start of the line. With the escape present, `^[ ]*Tests` cannot match
   `\x1b[2m Tests`; stripped, it can. So a declaration may match **more** lines
   than it did. Since `minimum` reads the **last match**, a broadened pattern can
   change the number the ratchet sees: given a plain `Tests  377 passed` followed
   by a colourised `Tests  2 passed`, the raw bytes yield `377` and the stripped
   bytes yield `2`. **Write patterns specific enough that this cannot bite** —
   anchor the whole line, and do not let one pattern cover two different
   summary lines.

2. **`.` counts different bytes on each side.** A pattern that positions itself
   with a fixed number of `.` sees escape bytes before and visible bytes after,
   so `^.{6}Tests` matches one line raw and a different line stripped. Do not
   count characters to find a position; match the words.

The property that *is* unconditional, and the reason the ruling still stands:
stripping only ever **deletes**. It never inserts or reorders a byte, so it
cannot fabricate a match out of nothing.

Stripping also removes a quieter defect in the other direction. `\x1b[38;5;208m`
is a 256-colour **index**, and a gate that ran 3 tests and printed
`\x1b[38;5;208m3 passed` matches `^.*?([0-9]+).* passed$` with group(1) equal to
`38` — so `minimum: 38` was green over a suite of three. Colour-free matching is
what makes the number in the log the number the gate printed.

**`external` is required, always.** Its absence is the defect that let
identity's suite be green against an empty schema. And `satisfy.command` is an
argv you can paste, not a sentence: a pointer to a wiki page that does not exist
is exactly what this field replaced. When `satisfy.command[0]` contains a `/` the
checker verifies the file is there, because that is a claim about **this**
repository. When it is a bare name it is a claim about **this machine**, and the
checker deliberately does not settle it — it reports `gate.requirement-unproven`
and leaves the exit code alone.

## Reading a gate's exit code without inventing the false green

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -o pipefail          # NOT `set -e` alone: that does not see through a pipe

bin/prime 2>&1 | tee "$RUNNER_TEMP/prime.log"
status=${PIPESTATUS[0]}  # NOT `$?`, which is tail's, and tail is always 0
exit "$status"
```

`PIPESTATUS` is a **bash** array. **zsh has no `PIPESTATUS`**, and this is not
a documentation detail: it has already produced one green over a red gate in
this fleet. If your shell is zsh, either run it under `bash` as above or do not
pipe at all. A script you leave behind must carry `set -o pipefail` at the top
too — `harness/bin/gate-check` does, and so does every other script in this
repository.

`harness/gate_check.py` itself never pipes: it calls `subprocess.run` with the
argv and no shell, so its exit code is the gate's own and the whole class of
defect above is structurally impossible for it.

## What the checker reports

`{ok, warn, fail}`, which is yamine's shape as MD13 recorded it, and
**`warn` never moves the exit code**. A gate built on booleans forces a choice
between "fail on warnings" (noisy, gets disabled) and "ignore them" (the report
is a lie). All five warnings here are the same kind of thing — *this machine
could not answer that* — and a checker that turned them into failures would be
red on a laptop and green on CI, which is the same defect in a new place.

| id | severity | what it catches |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gate.declaration-missing` | fail | the repository declares no gate at all |
| `gate.declaration-unreadable` | fail | the declaration is YAML core's reader refuses |
| `gate.schema` | fail | the declaration does not satisfy `schemas/gate.schema.json` |
| `gate.command-missing` | fail | `command[0]` names a file this repository does not have |
| `gate.command-unknown` | warn | `command[0]` is a bare name not on PATH **here** |
| `gate.entrypoint-missing` | fail | `entrypoint` is not a file |
| `gate.entrypoint-not-executable` | fail | `entrypoint` cannot be run |
| `gate.task-config-missing` | fail | a `miseTask` is named and there is no `mise.toml` |
| `gate.task-missing` | fail | the named task is not in the mise config |
| `gate.task-unresolvable` | fail | the task's `run` resolves to a different file |
| `gate.task-unreadable` | warn | the task's `run` is a shell string, not an argv |
| `gate.task-undeclared` | warn | a mise config with tasks, and no `miseTask` named |
| `gate.ci-missing` | fail | the named workflow is not a file |
| `gate.ci-disagrees` | fail | the workflow never invokes the gate, and nothing in it defers to a task runner either |
| `gate.ci-unproven` | warn | no step reads as the gate, but the workflow defers to a task runner this checker cannot follow |
| `gate.ci-undeclared` | warn | the declaration says nothing about CI |
| `gate.proof-invalid` | fail | a pattern that will not compile, or a floor with no group to read it from |
| `gate.proof-missing` | fail | **the gate exited 0 and did not emit a declared proof** |
| `gate.floor` | fail | the proof's count is below the promised floor |
| `gate.nonzero` | fail | the gate exited nonzero |
| `gate.timeout` | fail | the gate outlived `gate.timeoutSeconds` |
| `gate.requirement-path-missing` | fail | a requirement's command names a file that is not there |
| `gate.requirement-unproven` | warn | a requirement nobody ran, by design |

Exit codes: **0** no failure (warnings may still be printed), **1** at least
one failure, **2** the check could not happen. Never 0 and never 1 for a run
that could not read the declaration — a missing checkout is not a clean bill of
health, it is an unknown, and core's rule about skipped tests is the same rule.

`harness/gate_findings.json` is the inventory, every finding with the claim it
makes and the exact command that fixes it, plus a `notEnforced` list of what
this checker does **not** prove. Every message carries its remediation because
that is the single most transferable thing in yamine's 7,000 lines, and the
reason the fleet decided not to copy the rest of it.

### How many times, and through what

`gate.ci-disagrees` is the check whose entire job is noticing that CI stopped
running the gate. It had no written-down answer for the two most common shapes a
workflow can take, and it guessed wrong on both. So here is the answer, in full,
with the reasoning. The teeth are in `tests/test_specs.py`
(`test_gate_ci_multi_invocation_and_indirect_invocation_have_a_stated_policy`)
and in `harness/tests/gate_self_test.sh`; this is the prose they came from.

**A PASS in three shapes.**

1. Every element of `invokes` appears in some `run:` body — **once, or any number
   of times.** `invokes` is a claim that the gate is *reachable* from CI, not a
   count of how often it is reached. core's own workflow runs `bin/prime` at
   ci.yml:186 and `bin/prime --pytest` at ci.yml:338 — two entry points to one
   suite, asserted to report the same number of tests — and the declaration names
   only the first. A checker that read multiplicity as drift would fire on the
   repository that wrote the rule. One is not "more correct" than two; the
   question is never *how many*.
2. The workflow calls the mise task the declaration names — `mise run prime`,
   where `mise.toml`'s `[tasks.prime]` resolves to the declared `entrypoint`.
   This is a pass because it is *provable*, not because it is plausible:
   `check_task` has already read `mise.toml` and established the resolution for
   `gate.task-unresolvable`, and this reuses that proof to read a second spelling
   of the same command. Nothing is taken on trust. (If that task does *not*
   resolve, `gate.task-unresolvable` is already a failure, so a repository cannot
   buy its way to green through this path.)
3. A job that only calls a reusable workflow, sitting beside a step that runs the
   gate. That is `guard` and `parlor` both, and it needs no special case: the
   `uses:` line is simply not a `run:` body, so it is not read, and the step that
   *is* one is.

**A WARNING when the gate is behind a wrapper nobody declared.** `make gate`,
`./scripts/ci.sh`, a task the declaration does not name. This checker reads no
Makefile and no shell script, so a wrapper that calls the gate and a wrapper whose
target was emptied are *the same text* to it. Failing there is the false red this
checker shipped for a fleet release — the one that made `cafaye-rb` rewrite its
own workflow to satisfy it. Staying silent is the false green. So it is
`gate.ci-unproven`, it prints what it could not see, and it exits 0.

**Its leak, named rather than hidden.** The warning fires on *any* task-runner
step, so a workflow whose only task call is unrelated warns instead of failing —
which means deleting the gate step from such a repository costs a warning, not a
red. That is the price of not crying wolf, and it is a real price. The
alternative was measured, not assumed: `gate.ci-disagrees` failing on every
wrapper-gated repository is precisely what made this standard harder to adopt
than the thing it standardises. Anyone who wants the strict reading back gets it
by deleting the `TASK_RUNNER_CALL` branch in `check_ci` — one `if`, and the
warning goes with it.

**A FAILURE when the run bodies contain nothing that gates at all.** No step, no
task runner, no declaration of any kind. CI plainly does not run the gate, and
that is the whole job of this check. This stays a failure precisely *because* the
warning tier above is narrow: a plain workflow that lost its gate step still goes
red, which is the case the check exists for.

**What is not in this policy, and why.** The obvious alternative — a declared
`ci.indirect` list, so a repository could name its own wrapper and get a
straight pass — was rejected *for this packet*, and the one-line path to it is
recorded rather than left in a discussion: adding an optional string array to the
`ci` block of `schemas/gate.schema.json` plus three lines in `check_ci`. The
reason to wait is that the standard is being adopted right now, and asking every
adopting repository to learn a new key on day one to dodge a false red is a worse
migration than a warning that explains itself. The warning names the fix in its
own text, so nobody has to guess.

### The spellings `run:` is read in

The other half of the same story, and the reason the false red reached three
repositories. `workflow_run_lines` used to match `run:` only when the key was
bare or carried a `|`/`>` block scalar, so **every one-line `run:` was invisible**
— including `guard/ci.yml:65` (`run: bin/prime`) and `parlor/ci.yml:81`
(`run: ./bin/prime`), both of which run the gate and were both reported as not
running it. Across the twelve workflow trees this standard was written for, 139
`run:` keys: 101 block scalars and 38 one-liners. The 38 were the invisible ones.

Read now: `run: |` and its `>`/`-`/`+` variants; `run: <command>` with any
arguments and any quoted variables; `- run: <command>` (zero occurrences here,
included anyway — a shape absent from today's tree is not a shape that should be
invisible); and a bare `run:` whose value is on the lines below it.

One shape is deliberately **not** read as a command, and it is the reason the
anchor is not simply deleted: a `run:` whose whole value is a comment. PyYAML
reads `run: # TODO: wire up bin/gate` as `None` — there is no command on that
line at all — so treating the comment as one is a green badge on a workflow that
runs nothing. A trailing comment on a line that *does* carry a command is kept,
because removing it would truncate the only part that matters.

And one thing a correct pattern costs, named because it did not exist while the
pattern was wrong: `workflow_run_lines` tracks indentation inside a `run:` block
and nothing else, so a line reading `run: bin/gate` *nested under another
mapping* — an `env:` value, a `with:` input — is read as a command. Measured
across the 139 `run:` keys in those twelve trees: every one is a direct child of
a step's `- name:`/`- uses:`, and not one is nested. Closing it properly means
parsing, which is the second YAML dialect this file exists to avoid, so it is
recorded in `gate_findings.json` rather than half-fixed.

### The two phases, and why there are two

- **Static** (the default): the declaration against the tree. Nothing is run.
- **`--prove`**: runs the declared gate and requires every proof to appear.

`bin/prime` runs the **static** half and must not run the proving half: the
checker runs the gate, and the gate runs the checker, so a gate that verifies
itself by running itself terminates and the termination is all it proves. The
proving half is a step of core's CI of its own.

### It never prints the gate's environment, or the gate's output

No off-the-shelf tool detects a secret *leaked at runtime* into a log or an error
string — 0 of 268 Semgrep rules intersect CWE-532, gosec has no
`ast.CallExpr` case, Bandit is `ast.Constant`-only. So this checker prints the
command **as written** and never its expansion, and the gate's stdout goes to a
log file whose path is reported. A finding that quoted a failing test's output
would be a new place a credential lands, and a CI log is kept forever and read
by people who were not there.
`test_the_gate_checker_never_prints_a_value_read_from_the_environment` runs a
gate that prints a connection string and asserts the report is clean and the log
holds it.

### The red proof

`harness/tests/gate_self_test.sh` copies one conforming fixture twenty-three
times, breaks exactly one thing in each, and asserts the checker goes red **and
names the finding it expects**. A control on the unbroken fixture runs first —
without it, twenty-three reds prove nothing. Five of the cases are warnings, and
`expect_warn` asserts the exit code is still **0** in every one, which is the
tri-state contract made mechanical.

Breakage 8 is the one that is not string matching: a repository whose
declaration is **entirely true** about a gate that exits 0 without running
anything. The command exists, it is executable, the mise task resolves to it, CI
calls it — and the repository is ungated. Nothing in the declaration is wrong.
The only thing that catches it is asking the gate to say what it did.

## What this does not prove

Recorded in `harness/gate_findings.json` under `notEnforced`, and repeated here
because a gate check that claims more than it can is the defect it exists to
remove:

- **That an external requirement is satisfied.** The checker reads the
  declaration; it does not start Postgres to find out. A requirement is the
  operator's to satisfy, before gating.
- **That the tests touched the dependency they claim to.** A proof is a line of
  output. 1430/1430 against an empty database proves 1430 tests ran. Making the
  proof strong — a collect-then-run set diff, an assertion that a connection was
  opened — is MD12's machinery and it is owed in `caf` as `caf gate`, by a
  different worker. This is a checker of **declarations**; if you find yourself
  wanting tier logic in it, you have left its scope.
- **That a CI workflow does what it says, in the order it says.** The workflow
  is read textually and one question is asked of it: does any step's `run:`
  body mention the declared argv. A step can branch on an event, be filtered by
  a path, or live in a job that does not run on this branch, and none of that is
  visible from the text. core's own CI therefore runs the proving half as a real
  step, which is the check the text cannot do.

## Adopting it in another repository

1. Write `gate.yml`. Copy [`gate.yml`](../gate.yml) and change four lines, or
   start from [`examples/valid/gate.self-contained.yml`](../examples/valid/gate.self-contained.yml).
2. Run `harness/bin/gate-check .` — the static half, and it does not need a venv
   or a package.
3. Run `harness/bin/gate-check --prove .` — this runs your gate. It is the
   step that is not optional.
4. If the gate is not `mise run prime`, either rename the task (and leave a
   `depends` alias if anything already used the old name — that is what core
   did) or accept a `gate.task-undeclared` warning and say so in the
   declaration's comment.
5. If the gate needs a database, a service, a credential or a network, list it
   under `external.requirements` with a `satisfy.command`. **If it needs one
